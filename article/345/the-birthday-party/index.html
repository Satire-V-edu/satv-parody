<title>The Birthday Party | Sarah Hopkinson | Fiction</title>
<meta name="author" content="Sarah Hopkinson">

“Mona, here, take the knife. Cut it now.” 

Mona looks down at the plate she is holding. The cake is shaped like a hedgehog, its spikes glimmering as shards of glass. The skin on her face feels tender like charred ambers.">

		<div><p>Long red cuts ripple along the contours of Mona’s face as she blows out the ten candles on her birthday&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">cake. Three are extinguished, trails of smoke emerging like fingers. She blows again and the final seven&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">flames collapse.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;"></span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">“Mona, here, take the knife. Cut it now.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>Mona looks down at the plate she is holding. The cake is shaped like a hedgehog, its spikes glimmering&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">as shards of glass. The skin on her face feels tender like charred ambers. A tenuous pile of paper plates&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">extends from her grandmother’s frail wrist and is thrust aggressively under her chin. The sun is hot on her&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">neck and she feels her dress simper closer to her flesh. She does not recognize the hands that hold the&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">plate on her lap. At the tops of her vision, her grandmother’s pink cap swims like a blank face against the&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">flat green lawn.&nbsp;</span></p><p>***</p><p>Mona is now 9 years, 4 months and 18 days old. She knows this because she keeps a small chalkboard&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">shaped like a daisy above her bed where, every day, she chalks a fresh line. She is sitting on the cool,&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">wooden toilet seat in the downstairs bathroom. Her body is curled together on the seat and a book rests&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">on her knees. She is not looking at the book, but instead at the frail, green tiles that pattern the walls and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">floor. The light sickens.&nbsp;</span></p><p>It is Sunday and she is thinking about how she does not want to go to school the next day. Her friend has&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">a new friend. A girl called Jane that Mona has never liked. The new friends have begun to sit together at&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">break times in a small alcove off the playground, chewing stubbornly at the delicate ends of raw spaghetti&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">sticks.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Mona, don’t be ridiculous. Why would you possibly want to eat raw spaghetti sticks. Here, take your&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">grapes.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>Mona remembers the sky, leaden and grim. The grey uniforms twisting in collapsed circles behind&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">her. She remembers nudging the taut flesh of the grapes folded into the pocket of her duffle coat as she&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">watched the two girls, noting their hair lacing in the breeze. She remembers twisting the edge of a nail&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">slowly into the muscled surface of a grape. Suddenly its flesh had flown ejectile across the innards of her&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">pocket.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The front door slams and, outside, a dog begins to bark.&nbsp;</p><p>Mona recalls now where she is and notices the book open on her knees. She grabs it and clambers off&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">the toilet seat.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Her grandmother and a strange elderly man are standing at the open doorway in the hall. The man is&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">tall but stoops slightly and there is a large brown poodle at his feet. The man’s neck seems bent somehow&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">and his shirt bags away from his chest. His clothes hang like his skin, stretched.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Oh, Mona. Come and meet Steve, Steve and his dog, Henry? Yes, Henry. Come and say hello.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mona looks at Steve. He turns his head towards her, but won’t look her directly in the eyes. His face&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">is so set it seems carved. As she moves closer, stepping lightly upon the sloping wooden floors, his face&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">bends, softening at the edges. There is something vulnerable in the way he holds himself. Mona feels her&nbsp;innards tense and she wants to look away, but she can’t. He holds out one slim wrist to greet her. It shakes&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">so violently that Mona flinches and her hand stops an inch from his fingertips.&nbsp;</span></p><p>***&nbsp;</p><p>It is a few weeks after Steve appeared in Mona’s house. It is mid morning and the leaves trail flames behind them. There is an abandoned railway line that runs above the town and adjoins the north side to the&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">west. It is usually empty, known for the town’s only acts of crime, a few muggings, one mythologized rape.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">The tracks afford a view of the flat industrial plain and the bleak hills beyond. In winter the hills appear as&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">bruised hordes drowning the small houses in shadows.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Mona is sitting curled atop a rugged fence at the west end of the abandoned railway line, her book-bag&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">at her feet. She is quiet and motionless. She thought her absence from school might have filled her with&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">vigor, with a feeling of adulthood, instead she feels simply numb. She looks to her right and notices a form&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">emerge at the north end, a stick figure cut black against the sky. She turns away and stares over the tops of&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">the fields. Corn peppers her retinas.</span></p><p>Suddenly she hears a breath rasping above her shoulder. She turns. Steve is leaning with his chest&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">against the fence Mona is sitting on. He is staring, like Mona, over the tops of the broken fields. She finds&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">the silence terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“You bunked off school?”&nbsp;</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">“Yeah.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>“It’s pretty frosty out.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I guess. Your dog’s cute.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Thanks. He can be.”</p><p>***</p><p>Mona and Steve have become friends. Every afternoon, as the school bell breaks the frozen silence,&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Steve walks his dog Henry along the abandoned railway line that joins the north side of the town to the&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">west, the direction of Mona’s route from school to home. In the perishing afternoon, the odd pair walk side&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">by side, Mona’s small strides rushing besides Steve’s easy ones. Their limbs retain a respectful distance and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">their voices are soft, barely more than murmurs. Henry totters a few meters ahead, digging amongst the&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">dead strawberry bushes that line the tracks.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Mona has never been inside Steve’s house because he has never invited her in. He lives in a small white&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">house with shutters that were once a deep green, but are now peeled and faded. Its front hedge reaches out&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">into the street and catches upon people’s jackets as they walk along the pavement. In the backyard there is&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">a rusting climbing frame the previous family left behind them and leaves crowd its legs.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Mona wants to see inside his house. She has begun to find reasons to ride her bike along his street,&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">slowing down as she moves past his fecund hedge. She plays words he has spoken to her on repeat in her&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">head as she rides, forming them into musical phrases. There is something about the curvature of his body&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">that makes Mona sad.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The days become colder. Mona’s hands, clutching at the brakes on her bike, become increasingly&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">senseless and alien as she rides past Steve’s small house. She sometimes thinks briefly about her friend and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Jane and about their raw spaghetti fingers as she rides, but not for long. She has begun to sit alone at break&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">times, at the edge of the school field, clawing the frozen earth with one hand and clutching her knees&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">close to her chest with the other. She finds herself wanting to brush Steve’s fragile spine with her fingertips.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">In art class she paints the same picture over and over. The canvas as a large grey sky and, in one corner,&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">two black figures: a small curled form and a thin stick figure.&nbsp;</span></p><p>***</p><p>The house where Mona and her grandmother live is large and bare. It is a nervous place where unopened letters bristle. Mona is sitting on the edge of the wooden stair, she leans her head against the cool&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">banister. She hears the phone ring. Her grandmother lets out a startled cry that meanders amongst the dry&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">wooden furniture and the bare walls. She listens as her grandmother rustles over to the phone, picks it up,&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">and murmurs in a hushed voice “Hello.” </span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">“Oh, yes, hello there. Oh, that would be lovely, I know we would both enjoy that. Tomorrow? At 3?&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Mona and I will see you then.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>Mona closes her eyes. She cannot stand her grandmother’s hushed tones. She scrapes the wooden banister roughly with the end of her finger (she has chewed her nail almost down to the cuticle).&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>Mona and her grandmother are standing upon the cracked concrete doorstep of the small, white house.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">It is 3 on a Saturday afternoon, and Mona seems unsure of herself in a blue floral dress and shiny brown&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">shoes. Behind them branches lurch and the whining of a bicycle grows louder. Mona clasps her hands to&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">her sides and thinks of the way raw spaghetti strands crack against teeth. The old woman ferrets anxiously&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">inside her bag and Mona knows she is wondering whether Mona will behave herself.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The figures bristle on the front step, they tidy themselves. They hear barking, a ferocious yapping that&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">seems unreal, like Mona’s hands at the end of her arms. And then, the door opens. The small frame pulls&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">back to reveal a greying man, thin, dressed in jeans a size to big for him. He beckons the pair inside and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">shuts the door behind them.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The rooms are blank. No pictures or photographs conceal the tired floral print on the walls. The pair follow the man into the living room. There is only one red couch and the man indicates that the two should&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">seat themselves. Mona’s grandmother does, making a show of the whole procedure in her tired, anxious&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">manner. Mona doesn’t move but only looks at the table in the center of the room—a poorly concealed&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">makeshift table of taped-together cardboard boxes.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">The man sits down next to the old woman and leans over to pour tea from a chipped teapot. Mona&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">stands nervously beside the table and watches the man’s hand shake as he pours, sending rays of tea spiralling over the red carpet.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Steve, you remember meeting my granddaughter Mona, don’t you?”&nbsp;</p><p>Steve shudders and the cup he is holding lurches to one side.</p><p>“Yes, yes I do. It’s nice to see you.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mona smiles nervously and her fingers flutter against her floral dress.&nbsp;</p><p>“Mona turns ten next week.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Is that right. Well, happy birthday for next week Mona.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mona cannot control her hands. The fingers are wrenching themselves away from her palm in violent&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">spasms, and she feels their virulent intrusion into the hushed quiet.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“You knew it was my birthday next week.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mona’s syllables are so sparse they barely disturb the awkward silence. As soon as she speaks, she flushes&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">deep red. Steve looks up sharply, a look of deep pain flashing across his cheeks. He begins to tremble and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Mona looks down at the carpet.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Mona, dear, what do you mean Steve knew it was your birthday. He wouldn’t have known that.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mona’s grandmother rustles her clothes like a chicken. She is perplexed. Meanwhile Steve begins to&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">change, unfolding his skeletal limbs into puffed-up curves. Suddenly his arm breaks out and flings the full&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">teapot across the room. It crashes against the wall and cascades of tea spray about the room.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Get the fuck out! Get out! Get out! Get out now!”</p><p>***&nbsp;</p><p>Mona, Mona’s friend and Jane are sitting upon a row of dilapidated swings that perch at the north end&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">of the abandoned railway line. Jane is tall for her age, and she wears bell-bottom jeans. Mona looks with&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">disgust at her bright green leggings and old turquoise sweater with a red dinosaur on its front. Jane wears a&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">string of pearls around her neck. Jane and Mona’s friend laugh and chatter violently, Mona tries to laugh,&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">tries to join in, but every time she opens her mouth a wave of nausea floods her body.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The air is cold now and flocks of birds scatter the grey sky.&nbsp;</p><p>Mona stops swinging. The icy wind rustles about the girls, whipping voices and hair up in gusts, but&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Mona feels herself cut off.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“I heard my mum and her friend Mrs. Brimley talking about that old guy, the one with the funny dog.”&nbsp;</p><p>“He gives me the creeps. But his dog is kinda funny.” As Mona looks out over the fields, she doesn’t feel the wiry blue string cut into her palms like cutters&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">into dough.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“What did they say about him?”&nbsp;</p><p>Somewhere, a dog begins to bark and blood squeezes along the blue string Mona’s hands clutch.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">The two girls don’t notice Mona’s swing is now empty.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;"></span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Mona is running away from the swings along the tracks. She is running away from the sound of barking&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">that rears louder. She clasps her numbed hands to her sides. The houses, flat grey brick against a grey sky&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">seem unreal, terrifyingly so. Clouds of rapid breath outpace her. The dog barks again, sharper. She flings&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">herself off the sides of the track and down the frosted bank. As she runs, her toes slip along the smooth,&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">green tips of the grass. Her body tips forward and falls, weightless, to the base of the bank. Her body is still,&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">crumpled. Wisps of air rise from her lips.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Closer now, a dog barks.</p></div>
