		<div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a popular myth about the birth of&nbsp;modern film, which goes something like this. It&nbsp;is late in December of 1895, and it is Paris, and&nbsp;the brothers Lumière are showing their films at LeSalon Indien du Grand Café. Tonight is the first&nbsp;public film screening in h.istory. The audience is&nbsp;cosmopolitan, well-to-do, and well-educated. It is&nbsp;not a large Salon, after all. The movies are all actualités of about forty seconds, but for each little&nbsp;clip the brothers feed in seventeen meters of film.&nbsp;This does not detract from the spectacle, not at all</p><p>These films show scenes from daily life. They&nbsp;are demonstrative in nature and their appeal lies in&nbsp;the simple joy of being able to look at things. One&nbsp;Lumière film is called “The Arrival of a Train at&nbsp;La Ciotat Station”; it shows a train pulling up to a&nbsp;country town platform using one continuous shot.&nbsp;The camera was positioned right next to the tracks,&nbsp;so as the train comes in it runs diagonally across&nbsp;the screen. It is distant at first but then larger and&nbsp;larger until it is huge in the center and heading&nbsp;right for us. And then the train stops, of course, and&nbsp;lets the people out onto the platform—but by now&nbsp;it is too late, as the legend would have it, because&nbsp;everyone in the Salon is jumping up or shouting or&nbsp;running away to the back of the room where they&nbsp;think they will be safe. The little wooden chairs&nbsp;have all been knocked down to the ground, and&nbsp;the Lumières are standing there cross or perplexed&nbsp;or maybe even gleeful.</p><p>In this chaotic moment, the film audience was&nbsp;born. It was a dotted line before the modern, a&nbsp;call to play the skeptic in the face of illusion. In&nbsp;A Short History of the Movies, Gerald Mast described it with appropriate smugness: “Audiences,”&nbsp;he said, “would have to learn to watch movies.”</p><p>Today, we are almost entirely certain that this&nbsp;never really happened. Martin Loiperdinger, Tom&nbsp;Gunning, and other film historians have made a&nbsp;variety of convincing cases against it. (For example:&nbsp;The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station was not&nbsp;part of the original ten-film program; it was first&nbsp;screened in 1896. For example: the film was flickering, grainy, all black and white, and projected&nbsp;onto a fairly small screen at the front of the room.)&nbsp;But the myth has stuck regardless, and the Grand&nbsp;Café anecdote is now part of the lore of modern&nbsp;film culture. Plus, the fact of its ubiquity may show&nbsp;us more about ourselves than its truth or falsehood.</p><p>Here is a thing that definitely did happen. In&nbsp;1902, Edison Studios released a short film called&nbsp;“Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show.” It was&nbsp;quite clearly a knock-off of a movie made in England just a year before, “The Countryman and the&nbsp;Cinematographe,” and it featured an excerpt from&nbsp;an Edison film called “New Diamond Express”&nbsp;(1900)—itself quite clearly a knock-off of the Lumière Brothers’ wildly successful “The Arrival of a&nbsp;Train at La Ciotat Station” (1896).&nbsp;</p><p>“Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show” is a&nbsp;fairly simple movie. It stars an unsophisticated rube&nbsp;from the country called “Uncle Josh,” a character&nbsp;who showed up in many films and audio monologs&nbsp;at the time. Here, Uncle Josh has booked himself&nbsp;a box at the cinema. He is off to one side of the&nbsp;frame, sitting in his box and watching the screen&nbsp;that takes up the other half of the shot. “The Edison Projecting Kinetoscope” comes up on the&nbsp;screen, and then a “Parisian Dancer” begins to do&nbsp;the can-can in a sultry, &nbsp;fin-de-siècle sort of way.&nbsp;Uncle Josh is so moved that he jumps out of his&nbsp;box and starts trying to dance with her. But then&nbsp;the film changes to “New Diamond Express”, and&nbsp;poor Josh is still there in front of the screen as the&nbsp;train starts to come, so he leaps with a fright and&nbsp;throws himself right back into his booth. When the&nbsp;third film comes on, it is a country couple fighting,&nbsp;and when Uncle Josh goes to intervene he knocks&nbsp;over the screen. The understandably cranky projectionist wrestles Josh to the ground, and the film&nbsp;ends there.</p><p>This Uncle Josh is hairy, and proud, and melodramatic. It is the dancer who first lures him out&nbsp;from his box—lures him from the left side, the safe&nbsp;side, of the film’s single shot—but the second time&nbsp;he ventures out, it is to intervene in what looks like&nbsp;domestic abuse. He does not seem like a bad sort&nbsp;of man at all: his bantam posturing makes him ridiculous because he does not understand that it&nbsp;is all an illusion. The lust, fear, and moral insistence that would otherwise make him normal are&nbsp;discredited in the moment that he gets out of his&nbsp;box and walks out past the curtain. When he steps&nbsp;in front of the screen, he disappears in the projection, and when he tries to enter into the world of&nbsp;the film, everything comes crashing down around&nbsp;him—and Uncle Josh is the one to blame.</p><p>“Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show” is a&nbsp;funny little film, but in moments, it can start to&nbsp;feel surprisingly sad.</p><p>At the start of the twentieth century, Uncle Josh&nbsp;and other rube stories gave the early film audience&nbsp;a reflection of their own viewing experience and,&nbsp;moreover, trained them against the wrong way to&nbsp;respond to illusions. By the 1920s, these films were&nbsp;no longer popular. They were replaced, in a way,&nbsp;by the urban legend of the Lumière Brothers and&nbsp;“The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station.” Anthropologists around this time also wrote about the&nbsp;terror of “primitive” tribes when they encountered&nbsp;film technology. The naïve country bumpkin had&nbsp;been replaced by whole audiences of the past, and&nbsp;by a colonial Other, in the popular imagination.&nbsp;</p><p>The modern spectator, when confronted with&nbsp;illusion, undergoes the uncanny excitement of&nbsp;being both skeptical and vulnerable, of succumbing to an illusion at the same time as realizing that&nbsp;the illusion is false. As Cécile Whiting has noted,&nbsp;an audience can watch a documentary about the&nbsp;special effects used in Jurassic Park and then still&nbsp;jump in fear when the virtual dinosaurs lurch from&nbsp;the screen. Yet it seems as if modern viewers need&nbsp;something else as well, some familiar way to deflect their insecurity onto the credulous, the uninitiated, or the weak.</p><p><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp;</p><p>“Reality television,” Germaine Greer said once,&nbsp;“is not the end of civilization as we know it: it is&nbsp;civilization as we know it. It is popular culture at its&nbsp;most popular, soap opera come to life.” The heady&nbsp;world of reality TV is no place for the skeptic. Just&nbsp;this year, there were numerous accusations that&nbsp;Kourtney &amp; Kim Take New York had been “backfilled” with scenes that were faked later on. The&nbsp;finale of The Hills in 2010 was essentially a confession that the show had been scripted from the start:&nbsp;after a last sentimental scene, the camera zoomed&nbsp;out to show Brody Jenner standing in an outdoor&nbsp;set in a Hollywood studio. Said Kristen Cavallari,&nbsp;one of the protagonists: “Fans need to understand&nbsp;it’s all entertainment. It’s all in fun. I would never&nbsp;actually put my close friends or a real relationship&nbsp;on a show.”&nbsp;</p><p>It is hard to get a grip on the status of fact and fiction in contemporary visual culture, and it is hard&nbsp;to understand how skeptical or susceptible we are&nbsp;all supposed to be. Since the Blair Witch Projectin 1999, found-footage style has become a horror&nbsp;movie staple. Comedies like The Office take on&nbsp;the appearance of documentaries, while factual&nbsp;documentaries, mix in dramatic re-enactments&nbsp;and performative interventions. As basic ontological categories blur, and as nothing comes without&nbsp;self-conscious mediation, reality begins to assume&nbsp;all the values and demands of the spectacle.&nbsp;</p><p>We are fascinated, and we are vulnerable. In&nbsp;this sort of landscape, there is not even a screen&nbsp;for Uncle Josh to rip down. You are not supposed&nbsp;to watch The Hills and then think it is true. But if&nbsp;you do not watch The Hills because you think it&nbsp;is false, then it seems that you too are missing the&nbsp;point somehow.</p><p>When the UK’s Channel 4 aired the reality show&nbsp;Space Cadets in December of 2005, the Sunday&nbsp;Mirror said it lay “somewhere between completely&nbsp;hilarious and incredibly cruel.” According to the&nbsp;promotional blurb: “Channel 4 is blasting a group&nbsp;of adventurers, ordinary members of the public, off&nbsp;into space to spend five days orbiting the earth. It’s&nbsp;thrilling, it’s exciting, and it’s totally bogus.” These&nbsp;would-be reality stars were hand-picked for their&nbsp;boldness and credulity. They were taken to a disused military base in Suffolk and then told that it&nbsp;was Russia, told that two of them would be chosen&nbsp;to go up into space (along with three professional&nbsp;actors who had been planted there to help guide&nbsp;the illusion).</p><p>The cadets were trained by a former KGB agent&nbsp;and their base was decked out in exclusively Russian products. (The production team at Suffolk&nbsp;smoked Russian cigarettes in case one of the contestants found a butt somewhere.) &nbsp;When they finally went up in the shuttle, which was a hand-medown from Space Cowboys and Armageddon, they&nbsp;saw a distant earth out the window thanks to Hollywood-standard visual effects. All told, the show&nbsp;cost Channel 4 more than four million pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>The cadets were put through their paces. They&nbsp;saluted a Russian “poem,” which was actually a&nbsp;translated recipe for English sausage pudding.&nbsp;They memorized planet names, made balloon animals, acted out Alice in Wonderland. They wrote&nbsp;poems about their youth and they hugged it all&nbsp;out. Just before the show ended, they held a space&nbsp;funeral for a celebrity dog called “Mr. Bimby.”</p><p>At the grand finale, the host opened up the shuttle and showed the contestants that they were not&nbsp;in space but in a studio surrounded by their family&nbsp;and friends. Keri said she was “heartbroken,” said&nbsp;she had been planning a speech about her childhood dreams of going into space. Paul from Bristol&nbsp;said, “Aw, man. We’re not astronauts. We’re just&nbsp;asses.” And Billy Jackson said, “This is the biggest&nbsp;wind-up ever. This is wicked.” Each of them was&nbsp;given £25,000 and a trip to the real Space City near&nbsp;Moscow. The host’s relief was visible: the number&nbsp;of viewers had dwindled rather quickly, but the&nbsp;hoax had been pulled off without a major hitch.</p><p>The reality-twist genre was nothing new when&nbsp;Space Cadets came around. Shows like Average&nbsp;Joe and Joe Millionaire had already applied a twist&nbsp;to the dating show format, as did the spectacular&nbsp;There’s Something About Miriam in 2003. The&nbsp;latter program, which was subtitled &nbsp;Find Me A&nbsp;Man, showed a group of English lads as they fought&nbsp;for the heart of a beautiful Mexican model named&nbsp;Miriam. It is an awfully tiresome show, but the finale is interesting enough. Here, Miriam stands&nbsp;on a balcony next to a cactus: she coyly announces&nbsp;her winner, who jumps forward and hugs her with&nbsp;a smug little smile. But the host intervenes and says&nbsp;that, before they can get on the boat full of money,&nbsp;there is something that Miriam has to say to Tom&nbsp;(23, lifeguard and ex-ski instructor). “I really love&nbsp;spending time with you, and kissing you. You see,&nbsp;I love men, and I love being a woman.” Tom is&nbsp;completely blank; the other contestants start to&nbsp;giggle arm-in-arm in the background. And then,&nbsp;of course, we find out that Miriam has a penis,&nbsp;and the joke is all on Tom—get it? Now the losers&nbsp;start to laugh, start to dance up in front of him—“I&nbsp;knew it, I told you, I knew it”—and Tom is looking faint then the host calls them all to order. Tom&nbsp;agrees to go on the boat anyway, because he and&nbsp;Miriam are “good friends” after all, and the host&nbsp;declares that a round of applause is in order.</p><p>And then Tom sues the show for defamation&nbsp;and sexual assault and personal injury through&nbsp;emotional and psychological damage. Some of the&nbsp;production team backs him up, and the show does&nbsp;not get released until the next season. It still goes&nbsp;to air, however, and—horrible treatment of transgendered life aside—There’s Something About&nbsp;Miriam proved to be a high (or low) point in the&nbsp;life of “reality-twist.”&nbsp;</p><p>Reality TV demands a certain degree of credulity from its stars and its audience. Yet to appeal&nbsp;to a media-savvy and generally skeptical audience,&nbsp;it becomes necessary to turn the viewers into producers: to draw a line in power between the two&nbsp;different sides of the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>It is hard to ignore the moralistic edge that&nbsp;comes with this form of spectatorship, especially&nbsp;when reality shows put participants through some&nbsp;ostensible test of character. Adam Mesh, who&nbsp;was adorable when he lost Average Joe to a pretty&nbsp;boy, went from hero to villain when he starred in&nbsp;his own dating show and chose a socialite over a&nbsp;schoolteacher. Viewers are always encouraged to pick out who is being sincere, who is being fake. (Often this choice determines who can&nbsp;stay on the show, as in the proudly panoptical Big&nbsp;Brother.) And when programs hold up the wrong&nbsp;kind of behavior—think I Love Money 3, for example—they can always hide behind the defense:&nbsp;look, this is just real life we are showing.</p><p>The “reality twist” pulls the rug out from under&nbsp;its stars, like “Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture&nbsp;Show” does to its fictional protagonist. And yet: if&nbsp;credulity is what these shows demand from their&nbsp;participants, then the space cadets and Tom (23,&nbsp;life guard and ex-ski instructor) are not really like&nbsp;Uncle Josh, because they are responding in precisely the right way to the illusion on the screen.&nbsp;Reality television does not make its contestants&nbsp;into fools because they are doing it wrong—it&nbsp;makes them into fools for obeying, fools for living&nbsp;out the spectacle, as the audience must, in whatever way will sustain the illusion. The skeptical&nbsp;position is no defense, because the very concept&nbsp;of “reality shows” presupposes the deepest kind of&nbsp;skepticism. Those who are more vulnerable are&nbsp;simply those who are on air, those who are desperate to be seen: those who are lured to step out of&nbsp;their box. The only safe space is right here on the&nbsp;coach: here on on this side of the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Unless. As the Space Cadets hoax wore on, the&nbsp;audience got bored and began to speculate on the&nbsp;internet. One of the show’s non-actor participants&nbsp;was seen in an ad for the National Blood Service;&nbsp;this, and the unbelievable credulity of the contestants, led to a “double hoax” theory—a suggestion&nbsp;that the joke might instead be on the gullible public, because in fact everyone on the show was an&nbsp;actor. The theory was dispelled by the end of the&nbsp;show, but it commanded a considerable following&nbsp;and seemed, for a time, rather convincing.</p><p>There were other theories posited as well.&nbsp;“Maybe it’s a triple hoax,” one commenter wrote.&nbsp;“They’re all actors, but they’re ACTUALLY going&nbsp;to get sent into space. The fame hungry twats.”Another one wrote: “Producers, you really need&nbsp;to get everybody dressed up in monkey suits for&nbsp;when the ‘Cadets’ ‘Return to Earth’ for a comedy&nbsp;ending.”</p><p>A stranger thing that happened was the confessional that Charlie Skelton, one of the show’s professional actors, submitted to The Guardian after&nbsp;the big reveal. Skelton said he found it hard not to&nbsp;believe that he was actually in space, even while&nbsp;he knew he was running an experiment in groupthink. He described the poems that he wrote, based&nbsp;on a past full of lies, and the hugs that the group&nbsp;exchanged at moments when he shared them. “I&nbsp;enjoyed the poems,” he wrote. “I also—it has to&nbsp;be said—enjoyed the lies. I lied about my father&nbsp;being a violent wannabe jockey. I lied about my&nbsp;fear of Christmas trees. I lied about not believing&nbsp;that Albert Einstein existed. But always the truth&nbsp;outweighed the lies.” In the end, the joke was not&nbsp;on Charlie Skelton or the British viewing public.&nbsp;But it just as well could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The founding myths of early film paved the way&nbsp;for a visual culture that meets illusions with a mix&nbsp;of the skeptical and the credulous. The country&nbsp;rube figure and the Grand Café myth have long&nbsp;nourished the vanity of the modern watching audience: an audience that is increasingly sophisticated, but astonished nevertheless. Now, however,&nbsp;in the unstable world of reality programming, it is&nbsp;hard to be sure that the fool of the hoax can provide such catharsis. And as for Uncle Josh, well, he&nbsp;was nothing but an actor all along.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
