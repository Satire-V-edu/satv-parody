<title>Blame Mariel (Excerpt) | Joe Masterman | Fiction</title>
<meta name="author" content="Joe Masterman">

into the middle of an idea my Mom or Dad was busy having, they would have shooed me out, beat me 
back with a broom or bat, like the intruder I would have been.">

		<div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>While my older brother lived, I didn’t exist, not even as a thought in anybody’s head. &nbsp;As a second son&nbsp;</div><div>who was also a second only son, I’ve always felt confident in my redundancy. &nbsp;Had I traipsed, back then,&nbsp;</div><div>into the middle of an idea my Mom or Dad was busy having, they would have shooed me out, beat me&nbsp;</div><div>back with a broom or bat, like the intruder I would have been. &nbsp;Then my older brother, Matty, didn’t even&nbsp;</div><div>call home for three weeks before he went back there to die. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>This was in Miami, in the days when you could still blame anything on Mariel. &nbsp;Mariel was the port&nbsp;</div><div>from where, in 1980, Castro gift-wrapped his criminals, deranged and in clean T-shirts, and shipped them&nbsp;</div><div>to us with a kiss. &nbsp;Suddenly, Cuban lives shattered and the pieces blew across this whole continent and&nbsp;</div><div>people came searching for them on bended knees and never stood all the way back up. &nbsp;And blame them&nbsp;</div><div>my parents did. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Matty was seventeen when he died and, in addition to ruining my life, was very much my brother, even&nbsp;</div><div>though we never met. &nbsp;Try and understand.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>This is my brother meeting his first refugee. &nbsp;Age: eight. &nbsp;It happens because the mango tree bloomed&nbsp;</div><div>and there is no more space in the house for the fruit. &nbsp;A crate of it sits in the tub, which they move on top&nbsp;</div><div>of the toilet in order to shower. &nbsp;Men ring the doorbell to offer ten dollars to pick the burdened tree, then&nbsp;</div><div>twenty. &nbsp;Or they don’t ring and lean on our fence until dad goes out. &nbsp;They look at him, offended, and&nbsp;</div><div>move away. &nbsp;Nights are making him possibly insane. &nbsp;He keeps himself awake, convinced someone is up&nbsp;</div><div>in his tree. &nbsp;And just as he starts to slip away, a mango gets too heavy for its branch. &nbsp;You can hear the fall&nbsp;</div><div>even before it hits, and dad is awake, and his face grows dark and bristly like a mango you wouldn’t eat. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>One morning he walks through breakfast with a machete. &nbsp;Cool, Matty says, and wants to touch it. &nbsp;</div><div>Where the hell did you get that? mom says. &nbsp;I always had it, he says. &nbsp;He sits and leans the thing against his&nbsp;</div><div>leg point-down and goes at a grapefruit. &nbsp;Armando on the corner charges three bucks each for mangoes, he&nbsp;</div><div>is telling them, dislodging wedges of his breakfast. &nbsp;I thought Matty could sell the rest of the tree, get sign&nbsp;</div><div>on a chair out in the yard, make a little gumball money. &nbsp;Huh kid? &nbsp;Cool, Matty says. &nbsp;You’ll cut yourself&nbsp;</div><div>in half, mom says. &nbsp;Ah, dad says, and picks it up and goes through the back. &nbsp;He goes to the side for the&nbsp;</div><div>ladder and carries it and the blade together. &nbsp;He stands the ladder and spreads it and checks for wobbles. &nbsp;</div><div>He turns the machete in his hands, studying it, the realness of its edge, and ascends, holding it away from&nbsp;</div><div>his body in case he falls. &nbsp;He hacks a few, but really it’s easiest to twist them til they pop off. &nbsp;The machete&nbsp;</div><div>is used for jostling the hard-to-reach branches. &nbsp;As he works, he talks to the tree about his life, about what’s&nbsp;</div><div>reasonable to expect from the time left, what he’d like to leave his family. &nbsp;He is perfectly audible inside. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Matty makes his sign out of sharpie and a flayed cereal box. &nbsp;He listens to Mom about cars in the street,&nbsp;</div><div>then he sells alone while dad reclimatizes in the a.c. &nbsp;The skinny shade of a palm tree swings radially&nbsp;</div><div>about the trunk, and he follows, relocating the chair and sign and the grocery bags gorged of mangoes. &nbsp;</div><div>Underneath is at least the absence of heat, if not coolness. &nbsp;Only one car has stopped, a mother. &nbsp;At least&nbsp;</div><div>she paid ten for only two. &nbsp;It was charity. &nbsp;Her kids won’t trust the look of the food, and she doesn’t want&nbsp;</div><div>many things in the house that just sit and molder. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>When the shade moves too far back to serve as a viable retail location, my brother moves back streetside&nbsp;</div><div>and plants the chairlegs in the naked sun. &nbsp;They are reclaimed by heat and sting when his own legs brush&nbsp;</div><div>past.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A man walks down the street, no hat, long pants, closed-toe shoes, probably even socks. &nbsp;Must have&nbsp;</div><div>been a walk whatever crazy house he just escaped. &nbsp;He is smoking, exhaling the shapes of his lungs in&nbsp;</div><div>vapors that burn away behind him. &nbsp;He stops before the boy and the incomprehensible sign and looks atthem as at things underwater. &nbsp;Dipping a finger into a bag, he parts the top and inspects the unripe orbs&nbsp;</div><div>that needed more time on the tree. &nbsp;He turns his head away before breathing out more smoke. &nbsp;Matty has&nbsp;</div><div>decided not to announce that all paying customers can have their mangoes blended inside into a Mom’s&nbsp;</div><div>famous smoothie. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Cuantós? the man says. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>For how many? Matty says, already seeing himself at school telling this to Señor Garces. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Uno.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Trés. &nbsp;Cinco por dos. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The man shakes his head. &nbsp;Es criminal, he says, trying to pronounce the second word as English. &nbsp;He&nbsp;</div><div>bends and grinds his cigarette into the road. &nbsp;He pulls another from his pants pocket, tears off the filter,&nbsp;</div><div>sticks the rest between his lips. &nbsp;Fuego? he says.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>No. &nbsp;Sorry. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The man moves on, towards the lighter out there waiting for him. &nbsp;Matty goes inside and asks mom to&nbsp;</div><div>take him and the unsold mangoes to church. &nbsp;That Sunday, he sees mangoes gutted and partitioned on&nbsp;</div><div>the after-service snack table. &nbsp;He goes up to say there has been a mistake, that one of the coffee ladies must&nbsp;</div><div>have pilfered the donation box, and is pointed down the table to the birthday cake that is meant for the&nbsp;</div><div>kids. &nbsp;He steals back as many pieces as he can, and later walks the neighborhood, looking for someone in&nbsp;</div><div>need of fruit as the heat makes it stink and sour in his hands. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I believe he got the better parts of his heart from fishing.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Our father was and is a charter boat captain. &nbsp;Every dawn he is, apparently, woken by the sound of the&nbsp;</div><div>ocean. &nbsp;You can’t hear it from our house. &nbsp;But when I was little I liked to touch parts of my body to the&nbsp;</div><div>same parts of his. &nbsp;Hand to hand, nose to nose. &nbsp;I guess my parts could know themselves better that way,&nbsp;</div><div>impossible alone. &nbsp;When we were ear to ear, I wonder if I could hear the waves. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>So he wakes. &nbsp;Back then, he would move the coffee maker to the hall closet so its grumbling wouldn’t&nbsp;</div><div>roust anybody else. &nbsp;One might just as well run an extension cord outside and brew under a palm tree. &nbsp;</div><div>But my parents are of the North, where the outside must never be trusted, and no amount of balm in the&nbsp;</div><div>Florida weather would convince them otherwise. &nbsp;Often as not he forgot to take the maker back. &nbsp;Conscientious he may have been, but the sea is loud. &nbsp;The drip coffee maker—each drop quivering over the pot,&nbsp;should I fall? should I fall now?—taunted his patience. &nbsp;So our mother’s first move in the morning was not&nbsp;</div><div>towards the kitchen, where she might lean over the sink, yawn into the morning light of the window, and&nbsp;</div><div>feel a mother. &nbsp;Her first move was to the hall closet. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>This she could stand. &nbsp;These were his most honest quirks; he gave them unto her. &nbsp;She went over and&nbsp;</div><div>waved the coffee steam away from her jackets and carried the maker back, knowing that everyone is not&nbsp;</div><div>perfect, and is the better for it. &nbsp;</div><div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>But the pee.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>After rising, before the hall closet, she detoured to the bathroom. &nbsp;I don’t know her ritual nor God willing will I. &nbsp;I know it was early, it was dark, things were unreal. &nbsp;Matty would have been awake, playing&nbsp;</div><div>quietly, anxious for food to get made. &nbsp;Basically it is entirely plausible that she overlooked for years a component of her married life. &nbsp;One morning she looked before she sat: the toilet was already full. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>She happened to curse then, audibly. &nbsp;The thought of that stewing how many morning hours. &nbsp;She&nbsp;</div><div>flushed, went, flushed again. &nbsp;She walked into the kitchen, where Matty was eating from a cereal box with&nbsp;</div><div>a spoon. &nbsp;They startled each other, both of them caught in their different acts. &nbsp;She left, came back. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Sorry I cursed, she said. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>S’okay, my brother said. &nbsp;He doesn’t flush cause it’ll wake us up. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>That night she called a family powwow. &nbsp;She told dad she’d cursed in front of Matty. &nbsp;She asked Matty&nbsp;</div><div>to forgive her. &nbsp;He did, again. &nbsp;Then she announced that, regarding toilet business, respect for sleepers was&nbsp;</div><div>appreciated but not extenuating.</div><div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I saw a son’s share of powwows, too, years after Matty’s last. &nbsp;Some of the structures they built around him&nbsp;</div><div>hadn’t fallen before I came around. &nbsp;I could enter, sightsee, imagine how nice it must have been. &nbsp;In these&nbsp;</div><div>meetings we sat separately. &nbsp;No pair could form a front against the third, no axis of powwow power. &nbsp;Which&nbsp;</div><div>meant we had to pull a chair from the kitchen and Dad sat alone on the sofa. &nbsp;No one quite knew how&nbsp;</div><div>not to stare into the empty, person-sized space beside him. &nbsp;I sat on the floor, spurning the imported chair&nbsp;and the efforts it implied and the whole conversation, but also punishing myself both for my contempt&nbsp;</div><div>and my inability to stand up and leave. &nbsp;I felt very complicated then. &nbsp;Dad was a sport, though he was lost&nbsp;</div><div>after ten minutes. &nbsp;Mom talked, asked us to share, nodded appreciatively as we mumbled whatever back. &nbsp;</div><div>A great talent of hers. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>But I wonder what Dad really thought, sitting there with his fisherman’s eyes, brushing his knee against&nbsp;</div><div>that vacancy. &nbsp;Fisherman, as an adjective, suggests something that is not truly expressed unless it is looking to something, or nothing, very far away. &nbsp;So far I’ve found it applicable only to the eyes and the heart. &nbsp;</div><div>What did he think of me down there picking at the rug, of the kinds of trouble I was bound for? &nbsp;Maybe&nbsp;</div><div>he said, but not with any clarity that I remember. &nbsp;The living room was our biggest, still it wasn’t ocean&nbsp;</div><div>enough for him to feel home. &nbsp;I suppose what I most want his eyes for is their memory of what Matty was&nbsp;</div><div>like to have around. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Anyway, Dad’s morning movements were but a gentle presence. &nbsp;So gentle that no sleeper in the house&nbsp;</div><div>could tell them apart from the other evanescent qualities of morning, birds testing out their voices, sunlight spreading over the shades. &nbsp;You couldn’t know if they also happened in reality or just in your dreams.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Of course Matty was desperate to fish. &nbsp;Leaving with Dad at dawn would complete him as a person and&nbsp;</div><div>make him happy for life, like the GI Joes on the top shelf at Walgreens. &nbsp;Unfortunately, my brother had an&nbsp;</div><div>immaculate childhood. &nbsp;Mom left work for seven years, as she’d always said she would. &nbsp;She contemplated&nbsp;</div><div>nursing until he was four, well into his sentience, as a journal suggested; one look from Dad knocked her&nbsp;</div><div>down to three. &nbsp;No one else touched him, he spent every night in his own house, and no fishing. &nbsp;Even a&nbsp;</div><div>rod kept inside the house would enter an eye, topple a vase. &nbsp;But what Mom really knew was that fishing&nbsp;</div><div>was no short-term pleasure. &nbsp;It took men. &nbsp;She would lose another. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The sea is called many things. &nbsp;Vast, wine-dark. &nbsp;It should get called greedy more often. &nbsp;Its smell infiltrated the house when Dad came home. &nbsp;He would fall on the sofa and Matty would climb over him,&nbsp;</div><div>pressing the sea-laden air out of his captain’s shirts. &nbsp;Salt lodged in the creases around his eyes, which still&nbsp;</div><div>squinted into the wind. &nbsp;On Sundays Mom opened all the windows and drove our vacuum like punishment. &nbsp;A lot of good that did. &nbsp;The house was underwater. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Happy birthday, son, Dad said, producing a long package from behind the fridge. &nbsp;Matty was eight. &nbsp;</div><div>The other presents and money-bearing cards were opened, the wrapping and cake-smeared party utensils&nbsp;</div><div>stuffed in garbage bags, the other second-graders at last captured by their respective mothers. &nbsp;Matty lit up,&nbsp;</div><div>inexhaustible in the face of unopened presents. &nbsp;Dad might’ve looked fearfully, or defiantly, or connivingly&nbsp;</div><div>at Mom—however the one spouse who knows of an upcoming fight looks at the other. &nbsp;It was a junior&nbsp;</div><div>fishing rod, three-foot long, only fifteen feet of line, with a rubbery, No Injury hook attached to the end. &nbsp;</div><div>Thanks Dad, Matty said, not letting go of the rod for the next three weeks. &nbsp;Shit Harold, Mom said, but&nbsp;</div><div>when Matty wasn’t around to hear. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Matty wasn’t allowed to sleep with it—he was scolded that night for trying, spooning the rod and naming&nbsp;</div><div>the marlins they would hook together. &nbsp;He fell asleep staring at it, its long shadow on the wall, and took&nbsp;</div><div>it outside as soon as daylight let him. &nbsp;Maybe he saw sunfish flipping in the yard grass, or snook sneering&nbsp;</div><div><div>down their snouts at him from the trees. &nbsp;But they weren’t really there, so he fished the flowers.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>He was casting into my flower beds, Mom said that night. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>He’s casting already? &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>He pulled three bulbs clean out.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Last I checked the catch limit was twelve.</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Harold.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I’ll tell him to fish the garbage can.</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I don’t see why you had to get him that thing in the first place.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>You saw how he looked at it in the store.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I saw how you looked at it. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Matty listened in bed, decided not to ask for a back scratch. &nbsp;Mom pled on, trying to keep the household&nbsp;</div><div>safe, dry, behind bulwarks of reasonableness. &nbsp;Surprisingly not a great talent of hers. &nbsp;For a few nights, Matty strained to decipher the parents’ hushed argument. &nbsp;At some point Dad said, because it’s good for him. &nbsp;</div><div>Matty, floating towards sleep, bumped and awoke on those words—they were solid, buoyant, and pointed&nbsp;</div><div>in a safe direction. &nbsp;He trusted their sea-worth, and in that moment gave himself to their care, and slept. &nbsp;</div><div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Still, when he was shaken awake, a couple mornings later, he didn’t right away recognize the man above&nbsp;</div><div>him. &nbsp;Dad’s face does look strange, with all but its hardest lines slept away, when you see him just before&nbsp;</div><div>dawn. &nbsp;He helped Matty into some pants, with movements that spoke victory. &nbsp;They weren’t sneaking out,&nbsp;</div><div>for now. &nbsp;As they drove, Matty wondered why more people don’t come out to see the first light. &nbsp;He was&nbsp;</div><div>elated. &nbsp;He had a sip of coffee.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>At the marina, Matty met his second, third, fourth, and fifth refugees.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Juan Carlos, Carlos Juan, Carlos Carlos, and Juan Juan were their names—probably, people assumed,&nbsp;</div><div>their re-names. &nbsp;As starkly real and bathless as the dispossessed come. &nbsp;They were not, they said, of the&nbsp;</div><div>rabble, by whom they meant the criminal and the insane they sardine-sat beside on that famous boat ride. &nbsp;</div><div>As seen on the news television, they told the hotel guests. &nbsp;And they all four linked arms and grinned, as&nbsp;</div><div>if re-configuring a famous picture of themselves, while they each falsely remembered a huge applause&nbsp;</div><div>accompanying their adjoined first step off the boat. &nbsp;The hotel guests would promptly think of something&nbsp;</div><div>they’d left in the room, to which they needed to run for their life that very moment. &nbsp;We are a movie stars,&nbsp;</div><div>one Juan or Carlos would call after them. &nbsp;Their English was in fact much better than what they spoke&nbsp;</div><div>with. &nbsp;They had an appreciation for devilment that left little doubt of their hiding something, but whether&nbsp;</div><div>or not it was only their past no one asked.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Because they worked, and seemed to need only enough money to go out at night and come back alive. &nbsp;</div><div>That’s all Gus cared. &nbsp;Gus owned the hotel. &nbsp;It was he who carved a marina out of the limestone shore&nbsp;</div><div>and ran fishing charters for the guests (half-price) and general public (price negotiable, but steep.) &nbsp;It was&nbsp;</div><div>he who went to the beach when the Cubans were scattered there like flotsam and stood in the bed of his&nbsp;</div><div>truck and hollered that he’d take as many as could work and sleep in one room. &nbsp;He looked furtively for&nbsp;</div><div>news cameras, but they were off finding the whitest-looking refugee they could throw before their television audiences. &nbsp;Four men climbed up, one woman made a couple steps his way before thinking better of&nbsp;</div><div>it. &nbsp;The men worked hard, slept just fine, and smiled like they weren’t deep in other schemes.</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The Juan Carloses liked Dad especially. &nbsp;He arrived at the marina early, and clambered for his first&nbsp;</div><div>cigarette like a man needing air. &nbsp;He’s never smoked near any oxygen we might inhale. &nbsp;They thought he&nbsp;</div><div>was the funniest thing and, leaving their mops at ease, went to help him with a few puffs. &nbsp;They felt the&nbsp;</div><div>affection of strangers in the morning, unable to care what might befall one another, but appreciating the&nbsp;</div><div>warmth of the nearby bodies. &nbsp;The marina’s pelican, sleepy on a barnacled pylon, covered his head with&nbsp;</div><div>his own wing like it was all to much to watch.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Dad hadn’t exactly told Mom of their existence. &nbsp;Not that she couldn’t’ve dealt. &nbsp;But the marina was&nbsp;</div><div>his office space, and its characters as much his right to withhold as a buxom coworker in a problematic&nbsp;</div><div>neckline. &nbsp;He just didn’t need Matty finding them interesting enough to gab about later. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>She had asked, while they were drafting the minutia of Matty’s big day, if the men had hooked anything&nbsp;</div><div>undesirable since she’d last been down. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>If they did, Dad said, Gus would’ve made us grill it up for the guests.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>She moved on to a discussion of sunscreen application in a manner that suggested their son’s sure death&nbsp;</div><div>was on him.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>They stopped at the bait shop for chum, line, two candy bars&nbsp;and two Cokes. &nbsp;The smell from the bubbling tanks, where half the little bait fish floated belly-up, didn’t bother passing through Matty’s nostrils; it&nbsp;</div><div>grabbed straight for his throat. &nbsp;They got to the marina, which sits between the quiet hotel and the wakeful&nbsp;</div><div>ocean, earlier than any soul save that hopeless pelican. &nbsp;There was only the hollow hit of water along fiberglass hulls, the sagging of pier wood, and every wind-touched thing’s coordinated sway. &nbsp;Matty thought he&nbsp;</div><div>was witness to a new state of water. &nbsp;He’d only engaged with it through faucets, hoses, the shout of beach&nbsp;</div><div>waves and the touch of rain. &nbsp;He’d never known the ocean as useful or usable. &nbsp;Now he watched it move&nbsp;</div><div>between the boats, slow and colored like morning, preparing its deep bulk to provide for him. &nbsp;He lowered&nbsp;</div><div>a hand in to check if it was still wet.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I’ll never forget my brother’s first time fishing. &nbsp;I imagine the Juan Carloses wore their clean coveralls,&nbsp;</div><div>shook his hand, and scraped the grit off the dock like dignitaries. &nbsp;I imagine Dad said be careful about putting your fingers in like that, fishes eat near the surface. &nbsp;I imagine the pleasure Matty found, when they&nbsp;</div><div>reached open water and Dad gunned it, in crouching below the level of the gunwales, where the air keeps&nbsp;</div><div>still and warm. &nbsp;I imagine him looking at some flat piece of water, without a fish making a try at his lure&nbsp;for hours, and I imagine the better parts of his heart realizing themselves right there. &nbsp;I imagine that if you&nbsp;</div><div>asked him, then and there, why should anyone marry a fisherman, he would look at you, then back at the&nbsp;</div><div>water, and say, because they can be patient with this big mean thing for so long. &nbsp;I imagine, because I’ve&nbsp;</div><div>never been told. &nbsp;But I can picture the marina as it was then more clearly than I’ve ever known it under&nbsp;</div><div>my own feet.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Then he turned seventeen. &nbsp;Then he left for three weeks. &nbsp;Then he came back and then he died. &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The parents didn’t blame themselves. &nbsp;After all, they should have just left Miami when their friends left,&nbsp;</div><div>when they saw refugees on the news television and talked about leaving, when their parents called and&nbsp;</div><div>said haven’t you left yet? &nbsp;They stayed for pride, but there wasn’t any health in blaming themselves for&nbsp;</div><div>it. &nbsp;Because they’d tried. &nbsp;And there was always Mariel. &nbsp;(Even though, when Dad pinned Carlos Carlos&nbsp;</div><div>against his truck and asked him just what in fucking hell were his thoughts on the matter, he found there&nbsp;</div><div>was nothing in it. &nbsp;By then, Carlos Carlos was the only one of them that hadn’t died, disappeared, or resurfaced in Atlanta in a troupe of José Fernandos. &nbsp;All Mom needed to hear about it was that, while Dad’s&nbsp;colleague certainly wasn’t to blame, the tone and wording of his condolences implied that such incidents&nbsp;were tragically common and characteristically Cuban. &nbsp;Though, as of yet, my research into the subject&nbsp;does not show that immigrants cause drug addiction.) &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>They didn’t blame themselves, but after that they pretty much boxed it up and mailed it in, so to speak. &nbsp;</div><div>When he peed, he flushed and made no mind. &nbsp;When the coffee maker ended up places other than the&nbsp;</div><div>kitchen, she just made tea. &nbsp;If they ever had another son—which of course they wouldn’t—they’d let him&nbsp;</div><div>go fishing the day he was born, and he could stick all his fingers and toes where the fishes feed. &nbsp;When&nbsp;</div><div>they had another son, by accident, of course, he would catch them looking at him like he’d just crawled&nbsp;</div><div>out from under the sofa, intruder that he was. &nbsp;
