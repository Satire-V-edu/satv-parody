<title>The 450-Year-Old-Man | Sam Reynolds | Features</title>
<meta name="author" content="Sam Reynolds">
<meta name="description" content="Seated at the organ in the Stratford church, a man performs Rheinberger’s Sonata No. 4 in A minor.

		<div><div class="column" style="line-height: 16.8999996185303px;"><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Age 370—1934<br /></span><span style="font-family: ElectraLTStd; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 16.8999996185303px;"><br />Seated at the organ in the Stratford church, a man performs Rheinberger’s Sonata No. 4 in A minor. His back to the audience, he cannot see the procession leaving the pews to place wreaths on the grave. The only man who remains seated scribbles a note that reads, “having the air of being between a yeast factory and a steam laundry,” then adds in the description “ecclesiastical meander- ing” and underlines it twice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Before the organist moves to the Choral Song and Fugue, he turns around and squints at the de- parting patrons. Today they remember birth and death, and he as the organist celebrates through music.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">The reporter writes down another note: The second piece is “the dullest ever composed.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Next year the player will return, and he will play something less bright. He will not play something less dull, because he does not believe his performance was dull at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Age 50—1614</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Bon</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">res rage in the center of each village and public displays of celebration explode to honor Elizabeth I’s ascension. Everywhere the royal carriage rides, bells follow. Inside, James I listens to cheers for his predecessor. For the 44</span><span style="font-size: 6pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd; vertical-align: 4pt;">th&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">year in a row, the people of England celebrate their previ- ous monarch with a secular jubilee.</span></p></div><div class="column" style="line-height: 16.8999996185303px;"><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">rst 12 anniversaries of the Queen’s reign passed without national fanfare. Royal pageantry limped through the streets on occasion, but the invitations to annual parties arrived only with a papal stamp of approval. Even with the Reforma- tion, British holidays derived themselves from the Church’s holy days, at least until the 12</span><span style="font-size: 6pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd; vertical-align: 4pt;">th&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">anniversary of Elizabeth I’s ascension, when the guest list was cut down to the Commonwealth. Once church bells rang for a national monarch, revelry in recent history replaced ancient holidays on the British calendar.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">On November 5, two weeks before the coun- try celebrates its queen, bon</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">res and bells also harmonize. Parades pass though the centers of villages, with each patron rolling his or her own beer keg. The people cheer as loud as they will for Elizabeth I in two weeks’ time, if not with the same clarity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Gunpowder Treason Day arrives in the town square with the of</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">cial sanction of Parliament, and the social approval of the clergy. Soldiers march the streets with unloaded muskets, cele- brating nine years of separation from Guy Fawkes and his 36 barrels of gunpowder. The plot to shatter society failed, and to celebrate, the House of Lords feasts to the sound of ceremonial cannons.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">A bishop preaches the endurance of the Anglican Church against the Catholic menace, and the pews listen to his words. He praises the state, the lords, even the commoners. The commoners cheer outside the church walls, pausing only to change kegs.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="page" title="Page 27"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Age 10—1574</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Inkpots empty as Latin becomes English and sunlight enters the classroom from the west. Each bench matches a wooden desk, and the desks come from the same tree as the crooked beam across the ceiling. Below the bend in the beam, Will looks at the sun through the grates in the window, and predicts no more than 15 min- utes before the light departs and candles arrive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">In the corner of the room, Headmaster Jenkins watches the sun and knows it will set in ten minutes. From six to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">ve each day, he teaches boys fromtheagesof7to14howtogivelifetoadead language. This process repeats every day, except on weekends and Church holidays. Today is no different, except that it is St. George’s Day. It is also Will’s birthday, but no one minds either way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">While Will copies the motions of his fellow students, each translation revives a society known for power, prestige, and birthday celebrations. In that era of Roman domination, sons received to- gas from fathers, sisters and brothers exchanged jewelry, and even slaves honored their masters with shards of amber. Well-wishes arrived during the birthday feast in verbal exaltations from those in attendance, as well as tender letters from those out of town.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Exotic dancers poured wine throughout the night while a pig roasted on a spit and another bled in the temple. Other partiers placed wine and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fl</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">owers at sacred altars, and some birthday boys performed dances not to the gods, but to the genius. Viewed as a guiding spirit through a man’s life as well as a medium between the gods and men, Romans treated the genius as integral to a man’s identity, and used birthdays as an oc- casion to honor and worship this being.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Will’s genius may be watching over him in En- gland, but he shows no signs of worshipping his guardian. On his tenth birthday, his arms write without the clang of jewelry, covered by a coarse tunic rather than a silken toga. As the sun sets on Britain, Headmaster Jenkins sets a candle in front of Will to illuminate the past, not for wishes. As this light shines on Will’s translation, more candlesticks join in brightening the classroom against nightfall.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">When the evening bells chime to usher the students home, the thought of a birthday does not cross Will’s mind. He walks home over the cobbled roads with a Greek mentality, uncon- cerned with celebrating ten years on Earth. The</span></p></div><div class="column"><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">only celebration of birth in the ancient Greek culture occurred after death, when relatives and loved ones mourned their lost companions through joy rather than sorrow. But this view is unknown to this Latin-educated Elizabethan. The lack of excitement from the day carries into sleep, from which he will wake up tomorrow to repeat the same routine. In his dreams, he might imagine presents piled high around roast chick- en bathing in mists of wine. More likely, he will dream of nothing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Age 35—1599</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Groundlings wait for the start of the new play, one penny poorer, the smiles across their faces concealing the rotten tomatoes in their hands. Above, the middle class sits in boxes, having paid twice as much for the right to sit and throw toma- toes rather than stand with the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">lth below. Some sit on cushions, for three pennies.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Around the playhouse servants serve food and drink to every guest. From the top gallery, Thom- as Platter and his group of Swedish cohorts look down on the platform. Offstage hide the only fac- es without smiles, each crouched in character for the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">rst scene.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">The play begins and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">ve actors walk onstage in togas underneath Elizabethan jackets. A spot in the crowd only guarantees sight of the jack- ets, relics of powerful lords bequeathed to greedy serving men; they pawned these beautiful gar- ments to actors for a few pennies.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Tonight’s premiere of Julius Caesar seizes the contemporary fascination with Rome, throwing Latin lingo at the audience ten times before this tragedy of history ends. Halfway through his play, Caesar dies, and Brutus&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">lls his void with speculation and indecision, crying out to no one but the audience over the tension between “the genius and the mortal instruments.” His manic counterpart, Cassius, does not blame his genius for anything, but does forget to thank it when he remembers, “This is my birthday; as this very day / Was Cassius born.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">In lieu of pageantry, Cassius celebrates his birthday on the battle</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">eld. He commands his subordinate to stab him; he’d rather die than face defeat. Fewer than&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">ve lines after his death, news of victory reaches Cassius’ body, but he does not hear the turn of fortune. Instead, his blood runs over the blade, a respectful sacri</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">ce and cele-</span><span style="font-family: ElectraLTStd; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;">bration to remember his birth and death. Brutus meets death in a similar fashion, shaking hands with the afterlife through the blade of his own sword. He runs on the sword, but again, the hilt is held by another man.</span></p><div class="page" title="Page 28"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Once the performance ends, the Lord Cham- berlain’s Men walk on stage. Fifteen actors wide, they break out into dance: One wears a jacket, two wear gowns, and all celebrate. In the audi- ence, Thomas Platter and his compatriots ap- plaud their choice of spectacle for the afternoon. With two other plays across the Thames, they are content to have viewed what Platter wrote was an “excellent performance.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Age 284—1848</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Men gather to celebrate Will’s birthday in a building named after him. A reporter arrives and believes them to be distinguished, but their drinking habits quickly corrode their landed ti- tles. Scribbling down their names, he notices that around their pomp and circumstance, the town of Stratford is as empty as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Inside the building toasts commence before dinner, and continue as men wash down the roast with the wine. One man jumps from his chair at the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">rst opportunity of silence, raises his goblet, and cries, “To the health of the immortal Poet.” Others follow his example and down their liquor to the spirit of poetry and her poets.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Once the lesser dignitaries&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">nish opining, his Lordship, MP, rises from his seat and clears his throat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">“I am glad of the opportunity of appearing here as your representative, and I do declare, you are most ready to pay homage to the foremost genius of our country.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">The crowd cheers and he continues:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">“The writings of Shakespeare have contributed in no inconsiderable degree to augment the con- sideration and in</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fl</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">uence of England.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">They cheer again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">“Even in America they cheer for Shakespeare. In France, they discarded the heresies of Voltaire and admitted his eminence. And do not forget Ireland, for which he joins with the poets of En- gland and Ireland to bring justice to the West.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">The cheers shake the smooth timbered ceiling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">“Remember, the poet Moore still lives among us, and long might his myrtle be gilded with the mild and genial radiance of a protracted sunset.”</span></p></div><div class="column"><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Spirits splash over the lips of the drinkers, and the living celebrate their current poet laureate at an event for the great playwright of the past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">At a nearby hotel, a lesser crowd performs the same celebration, with the same display of feel- ing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Age 324—1888</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">“The entertainment is addressed to both phys- ical and mental nature, and begins with the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">rst course: the intellectual salad.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">A plate sits before each woman,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">lled with lettuce leaves made of tissue paper. One shade of light green reads, “There’s a special shade of providence in the fall of a sparrow.” A blade of imitation grass whispers, “Truth needs no colour—Beauty no pencil.” The bottom of the salad molds to a crumpled, yellowed scrap, with the words “Nature hath formed strange fellows in her time” faded into a crease. One particu- larly loud guest guesses Macbeth for each quote and receives nothing but a frown. For most of the guests, the scraps of paper mix without effort into their knowledge of folios and quartos.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">One book rests above each plate on the im- maculate tablecloth. The hardcover is too big for the palm of your hand, but just the right size to slip into a pocketbook, or a back pocket. Gilded pages slip underneath the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">ngertips of a reader, and golden leaves wrap around the spine to gar- nish The Shakespeare Birthday Book. There is no dedication or inscription in the front cover, other than one that begins midway through a line:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">My blessing with thee, And these few precepts in thy memory.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">After alternating between title page and blank page, Will watches his own words in pro</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">le. His head, bald up to the crown, faces right. A tex- tured tunic wrinkles around his shoulders, and the rest of the picture is un</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">nished. The next page brings the reader to The New Year, and the start of the birthdays. With each new day, two to three quotations prompt the reader to celebrate. As years pass, the book will&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">ll with names, and each name will be linked in ink to Shakespeare.</span></p></div></div></div><p><span style="line-height: 1.3em; font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">While the ladies of the Fredonia Shakespeare Club&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em; font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em; font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">nish their celebration of Will’s 324</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em; font-size: 6pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd; vertical-align: 4pt;">th</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em; font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">, 366 days await to be&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em; font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="line-height: 1.3em; font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">lled by birthdays living across&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: ElectraLTStd; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;">the page from quotations.</span></p><div class="page" title="Page 29"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Age 102—1666</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Will rests in his cof</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">n.

The streets snake around the structure, empty, but a brisk wind hints at the in- coming wave of visitors intent on overwhelming the town. Tacked to the front of the temporary structure, a bulletin announces the festivities for the coming week.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">A banquet is the only event on April 23, and will be presided over by Lord Carlisle. The cost to attend is 21 shillings, which entitles one to en- trance and food. In the evening a grand display of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">fi</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">reworks will shoot over town. This is the only free event of the weekend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">On Sunday there are no events.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">On Monday 500 singers, 120 instruments, and one conductor will perform Handel’s Messiah. In the evening more music will be performed, accompanied by words from Shakespeare.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Twelfth Night opens on Tuesday for one per-</span></p></div><div class="column"><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">formance and 5 shillings. Immediately afterward a staging of a new comedy written by Lord Dun- dreary will appear in a new farce. Tickets are, again, 5 shillings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, and Hamlet all squeeze into Wednesday, and music returns on Thursday for a collection of music from the plays of Shakespeare.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">The festival will close on Friday, six days after it opens, with a Grand Fancy Dress Ball. Those who cannot afford the 21-shilling surcharge are encouraged to attend the exhibition in the town hall, where portraits of Shakespeare will stare at 19</span><span style="font-size: 6pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd; vertical-align: 4pt;">th</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">-century faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">One week after the festival the wooden theatre will be destroyed, and all productions will return to the permanent Stratford Theatre.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Age 450—2014</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">Websites announce local celebrations for Shakespeare’s 450</span><span style="font-size: 6pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd; vertical-align: 4pt;">th&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ElectraLTStd;">birthday party. Stratford hopes to attract tourists to balloon its population of 25,505.
