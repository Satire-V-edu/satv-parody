An expedition two years&nbsp;</span>ago on the R/V North Wind IV had sampled animals from this very location. Back&nbsp;in the lab, one particular sample caught everyone’s attention. It was from a strikingly&nbsp;colored starfish - serum from their gonadal tissues was included in a standard biological&nbsp;activity screen, where we found that it had potent anti-proliferation activities against all the&nbsp;mammalian cell lines we tested it against. The results were so dramatic that we ran it five&nbsp;times with all manner of control experiments just to make sure we weren’t imagining the&nbsp;result, or worse, that some kind of contaminant was spoiling our cell culture system. Out of&nbsp;all the compounds we had ever screened in our years of bioprospecting from literally every&nbsp;continent and coast, this one had the most potential as a drug for controlling tumorigenesis&nbsp;in cancer. It could make all our careers, and it could repay our venture capital several times&nbsp;over - if only we could get more serum to characterize the active substance.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There were some unusual features, which we thought we could figure out in due time. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At high concentrations, for example, it actually promoted proliferation and uncontrolled&nbsp;</span>dedifferentiation. It caused fractal-like patterning of axonal branches when added to neuronal cell cultures. But that was irrelevant for now. We had to get more starfish, and&nbsp;figure out how to isolate the substance that was inhibiting the cancer cells.&nbsp;The starfish itself was difficult to identify, despite being so dramatic in appearance.&nbsp;Finally, a retired Smithsonian zoologist wrote to us, having seen the picture which we had&nbsp;privately circulated, stating that it was most likely a species which had only been collected&nbsp;once before in the 1870s by an Agassiz-led expedition. We found independent corroboration&nbsp;of this, and looked up the original description - although the atoll had remodeled somewhat&nbsp;over the years, the locality, as far as we could tell from the maps of the period, was almost&nbsp;exactly identical. The collector, one J.M. Hall, left no other notes or specimens.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When we returned we brought along the one field biologist in the employ of our com</span>pany, whom we all called Smithie. He was on the last expedition on the North Wind, and&nbsp;according to the collecting logs he was the one who picked up the starfish, even though&nbsp;he himself had no recollection of actually handling the animal. “It’s very odd,” he told us&nbsp;on the boat, while looking through the pictures in the file, “I would have thought that I&nbsp;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">would easily remember seeing something as colorful and charismatic as</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">P. flabel latum.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Our small motorboat halted in seemingly open water. I looked over the gunwale and&nbsp;saw that it was teeming with life below. Corals like tinsellated boulders, fishes, worms,&nbsp;sea fans, and other creatures swarmed busily under us. “They’re supposed to be on the&nbsp;shaded faces of brain coral,” Smithie told us, pointing out a few possible spots to scan. The</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">boatman puttered the engine and coasted us around slowly. “There!” Smithie gestured to&nbsp;</span>him to turn towards where he was pointing.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We came up alongside the coral boulder but it was just out of reach. Smithie leaned&nbsp;</span>over and stuck his arm into the water, but the starfish was still too far away. There were&nbsp;so many of them, they seemed to be aggregating for some reason. The longer we looked&nbsp;the more we could see. It was a bonanza, an amazing haul if we could get even a fraction&nbsp;on board and on the dry ice we had carefully packed into a cooler. “This bloody thing is&nbsp;getting in my way.” Smithie took off his life jacket and passed it to me. It was at that&nbsp;point that I noticed his eyes were red. I watched as he stretched out again, but the boat&nbsp;tipped and he slid into the water, head first.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The boatman and I caught his legs and started pulling him in, but it is surprisingly&nbsp;</span>difficult to haul in someone who is not making any effort to save himself. He was completely&nbsp;still, arms half-floating, head completely submerged, barely a twitch. As we pulled, I tried&nbsp;grabbing his shirt and tugging him from there. But the water around his body started</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">to become pink. Was he bleeding? My tugging twisted his body around and his face was&nbsp;</span>turned towards me, and I could see that he was hemorrhaging from his eyes, ears, and&nbsp;nose. It wasn’t blood, though. It was the wrong color. The fluid was leaking at such a rate&nbsp;as to stain even the water lapping up against the hull. I pulled my hand out and found&nbsp;that it was coated in tiny pink spheres, like the eggs of a marine animal.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I looked down to see if Smithie’s body was caught on something, and then we all saw&nbsp;</span>it happen. The starfish were enveloping themselves in a milky white plume. It was mixing&nbsp;with the pink cloud that now surrounded our whole boat. They were spawning, and so&nbsp;was Smithie. Without a word we let him slip back into the water.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">2.Hair</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My wife Sylvia passed me a square plate of glass, partly wrapped in thin yellowing paper, that was in the package she had just received in the mail from her cousin Emma. The paper was old and friable, so I gently pried it apart to pull out the glass. It was dark and smokey, and cracked diagonally across. There was something printed on its surface which I could not see clearly. I held it up at an angle to the light and was so startled by what I saw that I almost dropped it: an emaciated woman, eyes closed but with a permanently strained expression on her face, wearing a dress trimmed in lace, with long hair reaching down to her waist, lying on a cloth spread over a table in what seemed to be a parlor. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was a glass plate negative of a Victorian memento mori - a keepsake to remember the dead by. All the tones were inverted. The hair that should have been jet black was silvery white, as were the dress and the cloth. Her face was an eerie charcoal cast in this negative image. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">I set it down carefully on the remains of the paper wrapping. Sylvia was reading the letter that Emma had written and taped to the package.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She chuckled, “I’m sorry, I should have read this first or you would have been spared the terrible shock. Emma says this is stuff from a decaying trunk in her attic, that her mother,” my wife’s Aunt Jennifer, whose funeral we had just attended a fortnight ago, “had left behind and she thought since I liked family history I should have. That woman in the picture is my great-great-grandmother, Maude. She was only 35 when she died. That’s my age!” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I shuddered. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Here’s a locket which her husband kept with him all the time. Look at it, it’s got a lock of her hair in it. According to family lore this locket was brought over by Granny Maude’s own father when he made the crossing from Europe. One of the men in the family had found it on the battlefield after a vicious battle in the Napoleonic Wars, and pocketed it. So I guess it’s loot! That’s thrilling, isn’t it, dear?” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“It’s kinda creepy, actually.” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Well, I’m gonna keep this on me. Did you know that Abner - that’s my great-great- grandpa - never remarried? He raised his three kids all by himself. Never loved another woman. I’d like a love like that.” She smiled and pecked me on the cheek. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“That’s some way to put pressure on a newlywed couple,” I kissed her back. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two weeks after the package arrived, Sylvia went to the hairdresser’s, who was surprised that she came in so soon after her last visit. Her bangs had grown out and started tickling her eyes, and she wanted to trim them again. Barely a week after that, they were starting to annoy her again. She pinned them aside with some hairpins, and decided to let it grow out long rather than go back three times in one month. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was surprising how fast it grew. From being around her neck it soon draped to her shoulders, and just kept growing and growing. She’d not had hair this long since college, and she had forgotten how heavy it was to carry it around. At the same time her appetite grew and she began eating almost as much as I did. I asked her one evening over dinner at home if she thought she might be pregnant, and she threw a fit because she thought I was saying she was getting fat from eating so much. But to the contrary, she was getting slimmer even as her hair grew in volume. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually Sylvia was trimming the ends herself in the bathroom every morning with a pair of kitchen scissors, just to keep it manageable. It would easily have reached to her waist otherwise. Surfing on the Internet for “what to do with lots of hair” she found out about the Locks of Love charity, and started sending her clippings to them. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She was growing much less energetic, too.

She was hungry, so hungry, that she would be snacking almost continuously. My wife was wasting away, wrapped in a shroud of her own long hair. We finally went to see a doctor. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“This is very strange,” the doctor said, “I’ve never seen anything like this before. It seems like the growth of your hair is sequestering all the metabolic resources of your body. That’s why you’re so hungry. That’s why it’s growing so fast. Let’s try fasting for a day or two. Do you think you can do it? That might stop the growth of hair and break the cycle. I’ll prescribe something to suppress the hunger pangs.” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It didn’t work. Soon the amount she would have needed to eat was more than her gut could process.

It was an ancient&nbsp;</span>goldfish, almost as old as I was. When I was a year old, my favorite thing in the world&nbsp;was a densely illustrated poster of the freshwater fishes of the world. The origins of the&nbsp;poster, like that of all childhood totems, were unclear, but it happened to be taped to the&nbsp;side of an old bookshelf in my playroom, and I would sit in front of it for hours on end,&nbsp;babbling and pointing and staring at the closely stippled pictures. As my parents told it,&nbsp;they were worried that I would somehow lose my humanity by being fixated so strongly on&nbsp;an inanimate ob ject - so they got me a real live fish to stare at, and put it right in front of&nbsp;the poster. A quarter-century later, it was still staring back at me, in its fifth tank since&nbsp;that first September. It outgrew the first two, the third broke, and the fourth was too big&nbsp;for the furniture we bought when Shirley and I moved into our new apartment. I set up&nbsp;the new tank in our living room, and Shirley insisted that we put up the fish poster behind&nbsp;it again “to keep the fish company”.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By then, most of its golden glimmer was lost. Only flecks of color remained at the&nbsp;</span>edges of its scales, like glazed counter-top tiles that have become worn down by too much&nbsp;scrubbing. The fish (I never gave it a name) was pouty, and had a knobbly head. We first&nbsp;noticed the symptoms (apart from its general decline over the years) when one of those&nbsp;knobs started swelling well beyond something decent, and it began listing towards the side&nbsp;of the tumor.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, I wasn’t too upset that it was dying. I wasn’t the sort to be sentimental:&nbsp;</span>When I moved out, I junked most of my childhood things, because my parents wanted to&nbsp;rent the room out. Shirley, though, was upset that I wasn’t more upset.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“So if I were dying you wouldn’t be beat up about it?” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s not true. I’d be very sad if you were dying. But you’re not dying, the fish is.” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s precisely what I’m talking about. You’re ignoring it; you don’t want to confront&nbsp;</span>the fact that people die.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m not ignoring it - I’ve already accepted the fact that it’s dying. And it’s not people,&nbsp;</span>it’s a fish.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, I conceded the point. We set up a camera in front of the tank to take a&nbsp;</span>picture of the fish each day, and planned to assemble those pictures into some sort of album&nbsp;or memorial. Those pictures would effectively be a memento mori, except that it wasn’t&nbsp;dead yet while we were snapping the pictures, and frankly that seemed more morbid than&nbsp;sentimental to me.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Because we were compiling this album, I started to pay closer attention to the appear</span>ance of the tumor on its head, and thereby noticed the curious turn that its growth was&nbsp;taking. As it swelled, the growth became less a mere bulge than an appendage, and the&nbsp;scales covering it were new and deeply colored, but with a peculiar array of small black&nbsp;dots. This was the same golden orange that I remembered from the early days, when we&nbsp;were both much younger. The pattern of the new scales was distinct from that of the old,&nbsp;and where the two joined, the difference in color and imbrication looked almost like a seam.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A week or so later I noticed a shift in the eye that sat just below the tumor. The&nbsp;</span>downward pressure of the growth had first forced that eye to droop, but now it was looking&nbsp;upwards again. Within the span of a day, between the photograph we took on a Saturday&nbsp;and the one we took on Sunday, it then traveled an inch upwards and now sat in the middle&nbsp;of the lump. Simultaneously, the skull was caving in, as the tumor kept on expanding. The&nbsp;old fish was disappearing as a new one was being made.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The fish struggled for a month as the other eye, then the gills, and then all the fins&nbsp;moved over to the new territory. The transposition of its fins was the most curious step,&nbsp;because it was unable for those few days to swim in any semblance of a straight line.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, the old fish was nothing more than a whitish lump on the head of the new.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That too soon disappeared. We put the camera away. Shirley was horrified by the fish&nbsp;</span>now and refused to even come into the room, so I had to move the tank to a corner of my&nbsp;cramped study.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back to remove the fish poster that was still on the backing&nbsp;wall, I finally noticed on it what I should have recognized all along: the common goldfish&nbsp;Carassius auratus auratus. Our reborn goldfish was a picture-perfect copy.</p></div>
