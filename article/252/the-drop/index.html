		<div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="padding-left: 300px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I.&nbsp;</p><p>I had expected my first bike accident to be&nbsp;much more loud and drawn-out. But it happened in less than one second. There was no&nbsp;glory. There was no sound. I had simply ridden&nbsp;my bike and fallen off, landing twisted among&nbsp;the sand and metal juts.</p><p>I felt no pain, only a tingling in my left knee.&nbsp;I looked down and saw a large gash at the center&nbsp;of my knee. This porous stretch of skin contained&nbsp;little pink craters, each one containing a grain&nbsp;of sand, surrounded by multiple walls of flaking&nbsp;skin. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I stared at attention, fascinated at the transformation of my body, when something began to&nbsp;happen.A thick, bright red liquid seeped out from underneath, coming out from all the pores. Once it&nbsp;reached skin level, it bubbled out in the form of&nbsp;tiny flowers, which I intertwined until that hole&nbsp;in my knee turned red. It poured over the sides&nbsp;and trickled down my leg. The tingling turned&nbsp;into a sting. &nbsp;</p><p>I started to limp quietly towards the front&nbsp;door of my house, whimpering as I went, for I&nbsp;had just gone through the experience that every little girl must go through, of witnessing her&nbsp;own blood for the first time.</p><p style="padding-left: 300px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>II.</p><p>Since then, I have watched blood flow from&nbsp;my body countless times. I am consistently taken&nbsp;aback by its color, its silent movement across my&nbsp;skin, its slight saltiness against my tongue. Most&nbsp;of the time, I am not expecting it or the events&nbsp;causing it, unless I need to have it drawn. Even&nbsp;then, my own blood remains quarantined inside&nbsp;tubes and I am not called to interact with it.</p><p>But once I was, in my sophomore year in college, in a basic science class in which we studied&nbsp;the structure and nature of certain molecules&nbsp;essential to life. We often studied associated diseases, so when we reached insulin, we turned our&nbsp;heads to diabetes.</p><p>In a class lab, we had to measure our blood sugar levels before and after eating a glucose tablet. To do this we would have to prick our fingers&nbsp;with a tiny needle, wait for the blood to come&nbsp;out, and then insert that droplet onto the test&nbsp;strip of a machine for measurement. It was quite&nbsp;simple, really.</p><p>There were only a few pricking machines, so I&nbsp;had to wait my turn. I sat at my desk and watched&nbsp;ten other students play with their blood. The&nbsp;class, which generally stayed apathetically silent,&nbsp;had suddenly erupted into giggles and shouts of&nbsp;delight. I watched a tall lean boy next to me grin&nbsp;and stare cross-eyed at his finger as the blood&nbsp;came out. Another girl in the back yelled to the&nbsp;class that she had a lot of blood in her finger.</p><p>I prayed that I could get a lot of blood too.</p><p>The machine finally came to me. With the&nbsp;needle poised and ready to shoot, I counted to&nbsp;three and then pressed down hard on the release&nbsp;button. Before I could make sense of the pain,&nbsp;it was gone. I looked down, and to my delight,&nbsp;a small drop had already formed at the side of&nbsp;my finger. The drop swelled to twice its size and&nbsp;turned slightly darker in hue. I let it drip onto&nbsp;the testing strip of the machine, and once the&nbsp;machine was finished reading, I handed it to my&nbsp;friend.</p><p>Barely anything came out from his fingers. I&nbsp;watched him scrape the side of his finger against&nbsp;the plastic strip in order to get any few drops in,&nbsp;but it was not enough, and the machine showed&nbsp;a failed reading. He tried again, pricking himself&nbsp;from a different finger, but only a scant amount&nbsp;went out. The machine revealed the same result:&nbsp;FAIL.</p><p>I stared more than I should have—I found myself pitying him. Not because he couldn’t draw&nbsp;blood, but because it seemed as though his body&nbsp;did not hold any blood, as if his body had failed&nbsp;to keep itself running.</p><p>In the meantime, a giant drop of blood had already swelled on my skin and was threatening to&nbsp;slide down my finger. It wouldn’t stop coming&nbsp;out, and I continually wiped the drops away only&nbsp;to find them quickly replaced by another.&nbsp;</p><p>I was amazed at how much blood I had. More&nbsp;so, I was surprised at the vividness of its color. I&nbsp;stretched out my hands and imagined my hand&nbsp;without its cover, just a contained current of&nbsp;gushing blood. I felt pride.&nbsp;</p><p style="padding-left: 300px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>III.</p><p>Human skin is not very thick—just two to&nbsp;three millimeters—and yet it manages to hide&nbsp;the color of our bodies. If we peeled off our skins&nbsp;and threw them in the corner, all that would be&nbsp;left would be piles of meat and bone, complete&nbsp;with a set of eyeballs and spilling organs. And surrounding that would be blood, expanses of blood&nbsp;in all directions. Each human body contains up&nbsp;to five quarts of blood, enough to cover and stain&nbsp;the hardwood floor of any kitchen.</p><p style="padding-left: 300px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>IV.</p><p>The next time I pricked a finger it was not my&nbsp;own. I’d taken up a part-time job as a research&nbsp;assistant in a geriatric clinic. I first started out&nbsp;dealing with just paperwork, but as I finished my&nbsp;trainings, I began to run the patient visits.</p><p>For a particular study about atrial fibrilation,&nbsp;we were required to measure the thickness of&nbsp;their blood by giving an INR, short for international normalized ratio, blood test.</p><p>A sweet old lady dressed in pastel floral patterns sat smiling at me from her chair. I fumbled&nbsp;around, gathering my necessary tools for my first&nbsp;real operation.</p><p>I slowly put on gloves and sat down on the stool&nbsp;in front of her. Everything happened very quickly. I sanitized her hands, took out the gauze and&nbsp;a Band-Aid in preparation, removed the stinger&nbsp;from its packet, and before I could think, I had&nbsp;already punctured a hole in her—the sweet red&nbsp;nectar was seeping out of her body.</p><p>My nervousness vanished the moment I saw the&nbsp;blood. It grew from her finger, forming a perfect&nbsp;round droplet. As I milked her finger for more,&nbsp;collecting it into the cup as I went, it began to&nbsp;spread to different parts of her finger, collecting&nbsp;in the small rivets of her skin, and it left behind&nbsp;the same familiar crimson stain. I no longer felt&nbsp;like I was dealing with a foreign object. Her skin&nbsp;became my skin, her blood my blood.</p><p>Once the cup was properly filled I inserted it&nbsp;into the cuvette, which drained the blood and&nbsp;simmered it inside the machine. The blood was&nbsp;boiling when I took it out.</p><p>I thought that her blood looked normal, but&nbsp;when the test results came back, we learned&nbsp;her INR had climbed up to almost five, while&nbsp;the normal range was two to three. I didn’t know&nbsp;what that meant at the time—her blood could&nbsp;have either been too thick or too thin. If it was&nbsp;too thin, I thought, there would be blood running like liquid through her body and seeping&nbsp;out of every little hole—through her eyes, her&nbsp;ears, her pores. If it was too thick, it would clot&nbsp;and stick to the vessels. Perhaps her high body&nbsp;temperature would have warmed up the blood,&nbsp;just like the machine did to the sample, and simmer it softly, just until it was cooked and brown&nbsp;like the coagulated pork blood that gets sold in&nbsp;Vietnamese grocery stores. I could not believe&nbsp;she was so close to death.</p><p style="padding-left: 300px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>V.</p><p>Whenever one of our patients had a bleed&nbsp;event or was hospitalized for any reason, we&nbsp;would receive pages and pages of lab results measuring almost every imaginable chemical in their&nbsp;blood. I had to enter each value into the computer: the time and date the blood was collected, the&nbsp;chemical being measured, and its normal range.&nbsp;This took hours and hours to finish. Once, when&nbsp;an event came up, I sat in front of the computer&nbsp;for two days entering almost three hundred labs.</p><p>That was my first time looking closely at any&nbsp;medical terms. Some terms I could understand,&nbsp;such as uric acid, glucose, or sodium, but I also&nbsp;encountered combinations of letters I had never&nbsp;seen before. Gradually, I came to understand&nbsp;that rbc stood for red blood cells, wbc for white&nbsp;blood cells, and hgb for hemoglobin. But there&nbsp;were still others that, even today, I do not know,&nbsp;only that the values recorded were almost all out&nbsp;of range.</p><p>One patient was in the hospital for one week,&nbsp;from December 28 to January 6. When I paid&nbsp;attention to the dates, I saw that his levels were&nbsp;mostly normal in December, but come January&nbsp;2, almost half of his lymph%s and MCVs and&nbsp;MPVs were slightly abnormal, and then by January 6 his glucose levels had jumped to five times&nbsp;the normal amount.</p><p>But I was finally done, and I thought no more&nbsp;about it. I simply assumed that everyone was off&nbsp;in some way or another.&nbsp;</p><p>Later on, as I handed the paperwork back to&nbsp;my boss, I mentioned how a lot of this patient’s&nbsp;labs were abnormal. She paused for a second,&nbsp;and then explained that this patient had been&nbsp;in the hospital for quite some time for a serious&nbsp;bleeding event. She had been quietly watching&nbsp;him die.</p><p>I realized then what I had just done. I had documented the slow death of a man by watching his&nbsp;blood go berserk.</p><p>Blood holds within it the history of an entire&nbsp;life, and as long as we live, it flows through our&nbsp;bodies carrying evidence of our past, making us&nbsp;bleed and clot and cry until that history dissipates,&nbsp;and blood withers away with the life it once carried. Like how the lights on a switchboard go out&nbsp;one by one in a crashing plane with increasing&nbsp;speed until all the lights suddenly vanish, I was&nbsp;watching the levels of each vital fluid in his body&nbsp;shoot off in dangerous directions—until one day,&nbsp;when his entire blood system completely loses its&nbsp;balance, the last light will turn black, and he will&nbsp;have hit the end.</p><p>And I would sit in front of the computer with&nbsp;no more blood to enter. And a few days after, we&nbsp;would receive a safety notification letter from the&nbsp;International Review Board, saying that the cause&nbsp;of concern was, in cold, bold letters, DEATH. I&nbsp;would punch holes in that document and file it&nbsp;away in the binder used specifically for study correspondence, and then put that stark white paper&nbsp;away until it was time to move on to the next life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
