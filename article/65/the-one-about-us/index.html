		<div><p>The cutlery disappeared on Monday.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was getting my breakfast ready the same way I always do it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bowl, Raisin Bran, whole milk, spoon.<span>&nbsp; </span>But when the spoon part came, there weren’t any.<span>&nbsp; </span>No forks or knives either.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not in the drawers and not even in the dishwasher, and there’s <span class="SansSerif"><em>always </em></span><span class="SansSerif">stuff in the dishwasher.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I could hear Dad swearing at Talk Radio in his bedroom, which is what he does right before he barges into the kitchen and shouts about how he can’t find something.<span>&nbsp; </span>He doesn’t actually expect me to help him look, but if I’ve got to ask him something, I have to pretend to help.<span>&nbsp; </span>Otherwise he won’t listen.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Anyway this time it was his glasses. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I figured he’d want to know about the empty drawers, so after I’d made enough noise pretending to look, all dragging the kitchen chairs and lifting up pieces of the newspaper, I said, “Dad, the cutlery’s gone.” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I didn’t think he’d heard me, but then he said, “Where’d you learn to call it that?”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“You, I think.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">He smiled.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Really?”<span>&nbsp; </span>But it wasn’t a question and he went back to digging around under the newspapers.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Dad?”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">He found his glasses.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Aha!<span>&nbsp; </span>They were hiding.” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I said it louder.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Dad!”<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">He spun around.<span>&nbsp; </span>“What?<span>&nbsp; </span>Oh.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He scratched his head.<span>&nbsp; </span>“I don’t know, Kip, use your hands.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like an Indian!<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s what they do there, I think.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He took a deep breath.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Yes, that’s right.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He grabbed his keys.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“But the </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>milk</em></span><span class="SansSerif">, Dad.”<span>&nbsp; </span>How was I supposed to eat milk like an Indian? </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Don’t waste the milk!”<span>&nbsp; </span>He yelled from the door.<span>&nbsp; </span>“And don’t miss the bus!”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">That night Dad brought home pizza, so of course no one said anything about the cutlery.<span>&nbsp; </span>And the next morning there were six boxes of the plastic stuff up on the counter by the microwave.<span>&nbsp; </span>The next day, Dad grounded me, which sucked so bad I pretty much forgot about the cutlery for the whole afternoon.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now I just don’t care at all, because yesterday I found out I’m not the only one in big time trouble this month.<span>&nbsp; </span>Drew and Ellie are grounded too.<span>&nbsp; </span>And I’ve got to find out what they did. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">If we were little it’d be easy, because back then we were always together.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I think it’s Miss Allen’s fault we got split up, but sometimes I think it’s Dad’s.<span>&nbsp; </span>I mean, Miss Allen didn’t have to tell, but Dad didn’t have to get so scared and make it so we had to let him sign us all up for different activities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Drew got soccer, and he still does it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie got gymnastics, but she quit last year, which is why she’s sort of fat now.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I wasn’t good at anything because I always sat down at the ballet recitals or got too hyper at the acting camps.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I was Catcher in summer softball I made crow noises to scare the batter, which Dad said was embarrassing for him.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once at horseback riding lessons, I fell off and almost got run over by a cantering pony.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, finally Dad gave up and let me stay home.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Drew and Ellie and me had lots more dangerous games than Snowbank Ninjas, but that’s the only one we ever almost died at, I guess, which makes it worse than all the others combined.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;" align="center"><span class="SansSerif">***</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">The worst part was how Dad made such a thing of it, all coming to my bedroom with his arms behind his back and telling me to meet him in the kitchen in five minutes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Usually when he grounds me, he just does it wherever he finds me.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, of course I thought maybe he’d bought me those expensive Nikes I’d been asking for.<span>&nbsp; </span>I even slipped off my sneakers so that when I walked in, I could put on the new ones right away.<span>&nbsp; </span>But when I slid across the tiles in my socks and actually saw him, I knew I was in trouble.<span>&nbsp; </span>See, he had a chair all pulled out for me and was standing there, staring at his feet, which means he’s so mad he can’t even look at you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not to mention that then he took a butt-load of time sitting down—all crossing his legs and taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes and sighing, before </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>finally</em></span><span class="SansSerif"> he went ahead and said what all grown-ups say when they’re about to bust you:<span>&nbsp; </span>“Kippy, is there anything you want to tell me?” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I’m always getting grounded but it’s never that bad because I usually don’t have any friends.<span>&nbsp; </span>But this time I was literally dying—</span><span class="SansSerif"><em>dying</em></span><span class="SansSerif">—because Kate Petersen is having a slumber party next weekend and she invited ten girls including me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plus, there’s this girl Susan George from my bus route, and we’re not friends or anything, but I was sort of planning to hang out at her house this whole summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>She’s fine, I guess, but she smells like ham.<span>&nbsp; </span>(No one really likes her but can’t say so because she’s got LD—that’s a Learning Disability.) </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Anyway, Maxwell Mann from TV said it’s going to be the hottest June in ten years, which wouldn’t be so bad except Dad never turns on the air conditioning.<span>&nbsp; </span>(He always says there’s a “breeze.”)<span>&nbsp; </span>But see, I wasn’t so worried about Dad’s No-Air rule because the Georges just got a pool put in and I figured I could go down there when it got too hot.<span>&nbsp; </span>I knew, </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>knew</em></span><span class="SansSerif">, Susan’d let me, because she’s got no friends.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plus, chlorine probably kills the ham smell she’s got.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">So, yeah, my one chance to be friends with Kate Petersen, and also, basically, to have a pool, and I’m grounded for a month.<span>&nbsp; </span>This sucks balls.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">At least Drew and Ellie won’t know.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our Dad has had this thing since we were kids about tattling where he pretends to be deaf unless someone’s bleeding.<span>&nbsp; </span>Otherwise he covers his ears and says, “Tattlers help themselves” in this sing-song voice. He only broke his own rule once.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was a really long time ago, right after Nana died and we drove up to Atlantic City for the funeral.<span>&nbsp; </span>We still have the van we took.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s got seven seats, but that time it felt tiny.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie gets carsick, and so she got to sit up front with Dad, and even though Drew and I literally begged—</span><span class="SansSerif"><em>begged—</em></span><span class="SansSerif">to sit in the Captain’s chairs, which are in the middle, that’s where Dad put the suitcases for some reason.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">So Drew and I were sitting in the way back because of Ellie and the stupid bags, and what happened was Drew asked if I wanted to play this game where he got to punch me if I touched him.<span>&nbsp; </span>I told him it sounded pretty boring, but he said he’d give me 15 dollars if I won, so, like an idiot I shook on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then Drew scooted closer and closer to me until I was pressed up against the window and couldn’t go any more over.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course he scooted a little bit more and our legs were touching, which he said counted and punched me really hard in the arm.<span>&nbsp; </span>He did that for the whole car trip, so of course I started to cry after a while.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just tears, though.<span>&nbsp; </span>None of us made sob noises when we were kids because Dad’d either tell us to stop playing some fun game, or he’d say “don’t tattle”, and if any of us heard him say that, we’d beat up whoever’d tried to get his attention.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">So anyway, I waited until Drew fell asleep against his window and then I reached over and slammed him really hard in the balls.<span>&nbsp; </span>And of course then he started crying just tears and stomping his feet and slapping the seat in front of him.<span>&nbsp; </span>I laughed so hard even though I was technically also crying, but then Drew pulled it together and said, “That counted as touching, Anus,” and the game started all over again. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">By the time we got to the hotel, I had a big time bruise, and the next morning when we were getting ready for the funeral it looked even worse.<span>&nbsp; </span>My dress didn’t have any sleeves and of course Dad wanted to know what’d happened.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, I told him, which is technically tattling, but instead of playing deaf, Dad made the really angry face where he puts his top and bottom teeth right on top of each other, and chased Drew all around the hotel.<span>&nbsp; </span>I didn’t see it because I locked myself in the bathroom, but Ellie went into the hallway to watch, and she said that when Dad caught Drew, he held him down and slapped him once really hard on the forehead.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie also said that Dad farted and made Drew smell it, which at first I didn’t believe because, for starters, I was pretty sure that Drew and Ellie and me were the only three people in the world to know about Fart Fights, but also Dad was a grown-up, and at the time I didn’t think that adults could fart.<span>&nbsp; </span>I mean, I was only five or six, so I still thought that grown-ups were born big and boring.<span>&nbsp; </span>I didn’t get that they were just us with time added on.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Anyway, like I said, I didn’t believe Ellie.<span>&nbsp; </span>But then she swore on Mom, which meant a lot back then, and I wasn’t so sure.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tattled every day for, like, weeks after that to try and see if Dad’d do it again, but the minute we got home from the funeral, he went back to being deaf. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;" align="center"><span class="SansSerif">***</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I didn’t even know that you could check where people’d gone on the internet.<span>&nbsp; </span>Or, I guess I did know, but I didn’t know Dad knew.<span>&nbsp; </span>Turns out he’s like, this total computer genius, which sucks balls because I was at sites like lustylibrary.com and sensualstories.net.<span>&nbsp; </span>And not only does my own Dad know, but now I’m grounded because of it, and the parental controls for my sign-in name are insane.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can’t go anywhere except boring news sites and nickelodeon.com.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">It’s not like I was reading the stories to learn how to </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>do it</em></span><span class="SansSerif">.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I think about what it’d be like to freeze time and take a boy’s clothes off, but I’m not a slut or something.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just think erotic literature is way better than what they tell us at school.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plus it’s really creative.<span>&nbsp; </span>Way more creative than </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>My Side of the Mountain</em></span><span class="SansSerif">, which we had to read this year in homeroom.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">The school thinks no one finds out about it until sixth grade, so every Wednesday we have to listen to Ms. K talk about Judy—this plastic mannequin whose chest is sliced open so you can see the reproductive stuff.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ms. K is always talking about “penises” and “vaginas.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Everybody hates it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Online they never call them that, even though those are the parts they’re always talking about. My favorite words for boy’s parts are Purple Python, Gusher (which is technically for a girl’s thing, but sometimes they use it for boy’s), Artistic Cauliflower (that’s from a Finnish site, and I only like it as a joke) and Dick (which is a normal word).<span>&nbsp; </span>But my favorite is Schlong. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I don’t like most of the online words for girl’s privates, probably because I’m not a lesbian (I don’t even like sports that much, and one time, Dad made me cut my hair short, and it looked terrible).<span>&nbsp; </span>But yeah, stuff like “Cookie” and “Cooter” and “Beaver” are gross.<span>&nbsp; </span>The British sites call it a Cunny, which is like Cunt, which I don’t like.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once, in this story called “Victoria Goes to Camp”, they called it a “Poozle”, which was funny but not in a good way.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anyway, when I’ve got to call it </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>something</em></span><span class="SansSerif">, like, if I knock it on the kitchen table when I’m sliding around in my socks, or a baseball hits it, and I’ve got to tell Dad or Mrs. Pelech, who’s the school nurse—or if I’ve got to answer one of Ms. K’s stupid questions—I just always call it Crotch.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I don’t think about girl’s parts, really.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unless it’s during scoliosis checks and Kate Petersen’s got her bathing suit on.<span>&nbsp; </span>But that’s just because she’s got actual boobs already and I want to know if she’s also got a lot of pubic hair.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">My favorite author right now is jscackman709, who’s a writer for banginbookpage.org.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s a non-registered site, which means you don’t have to click a button that says you’re eighteen, and so there can’t be any words like “cock”.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s why jscackman calls them “cacks” in his stories, which is funny at first, but you get used to it.<span>&nbsp; </span>He mostly writes about incest, which means Dad saw I was reading stuff called “Playtime With Mother,” “I Love You in that Different Kind of Way,” and “Seductress of Hope.”<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re not </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>that</em></span><span class="SansSerif"> obvious I guess, but there was also stuff like, “Cousin Catherine’s Cunny,” and “I Recently Had Intercourse With My Sister, and Liked It.”<span>&nbsp; </span>So he definitely knows.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m so embarrassed I could barf. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I mean, it’s not like I don’t know incest is gross, but you can just pretend the people in the stories are boyfriend-girlfriend instead of cousins.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s really easy to do, but it’s the kind of thing you can’t explain that you do.<span>&nbsp; </span>Especially not to your Dad.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;" align="center"><span class="SansSerif">***</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Maxwell Mann wasn’t kidding when he said the thing about June.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s only the first week and already I’ve got to walk around in my Speedo (with tank-tops you can see my nipples, which’re sort of pointy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Drew once called them weasel snouts and I kicked him in the balls.<span>&nbsp; </span>That was the last time I did that, though, because instead of hitting me back or chasing me he called me a bitch).<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">That’s what the Speedo is for: to flatten out my “budding breasts”, which is what Ms. K calls them. I don’t get to wear a bra yet.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dad says I don’t need one, and Ellie doesn’t let me into her room.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well, technically I’ve been in there a bunch of times.<span>&nbsp; </span>And gone through all her underwear and stuff.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her boobs aren’t big or anything, but like I said, she’s kind of fat right now, so of course none of her bras fit.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Anyway, today was my first day grounded, and so after Dad left for work I went into his room and looked for secret letters and drugs and stuff in his drawers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Danny Kemp from my bus said he found pornographic pictures with his father’s socks.<span>&nbsp; </span>But Dad only had some golf tees and sci-fi paperbacks.<span>&nbsp; </span>There were the birthday cards from Mom, but I’d already read those a bunch of times.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I thought I was the only one home this morning (I even sang in the bathroom and stuff, which is embarrassing now to think about), but when I left Dad’s room there was Ellie in her pajamas, playing with the thermostat in the hallway. This always happens, where I think Ellie’s gone somewhere and then all of a sudden she’ll come out of her room.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Oh, hey,” I said, “I didn’t know you were here.”<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Anyway, of course she ignored me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie’s gotten really stuck up since she turned fourteen.<span>&nbsp; </span>She doesn’t talk to me or Dad, like, at all anymore.<span>&nbsp; </span>She’s still nice to Drew, though.<span>&nbsp; </span>I mean, yesterday I saw her mowing the lawn, which is technically Drew’s job.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plus her and him walk to school together, and since high school starts earlier than middle school, I hear them talking and sometimes even laughing on their way up the driveway. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I don’t think it’s fair that they get to be closer in age.<span>&nbsp; </span>I told Dad once that I was mad about it, but he thought I was joking and called me Cutie Pumpkin.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t even know what that means. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“You’re not supposed to put the air on,” I told Ellie.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I get so mad at her, and then I say something that makes me want to cry right after I say it.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Dad </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>said</em></span><span class="SansSerif">.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Yeah, like that.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I tried again.<span>&nbsp; </span>“I mean, besides, you could just change into short sleeves.”<span>&nbsp;

</span>“I’m.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not.<span>&nbsp; </span>Going!”<span>&nbsp; </span>Yeah, like that.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was quiet for a while, which mean they were staring at each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s when they do when they fight.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dad holds his mouth tight and Ellie puts her hands on her hips and raises her eyebrows.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then all of a sudden Dad said something so soft I could barely hear it, and it was quiet again.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Dad, I won’t,” Ellie said.<span>&nbsp; </span>“I promise.”<span>&nbsp; </span>She sounded completely different.<span>&nbsp;

</span>Back then I had really bad nightmares, which meant when Mrs. Galanis was around, I couldn’t go sleep in Dad’s room if I got scared.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie and I still shared a room back then and everything, but she doesn’t make any noise when she sleeps, which was sometimes scary to wake up to, like she was dead or something.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, whenever Dad went away and I had a nightmare, I’d go to Drew’s room and he’d get his sleeping bag off the top shelf of his closet and roll it out for me.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I actually liked sleeping in Drew’s room way better than sleeping in Dad’s.<span>&nbsp; </span>But it was one of those things I could only do if Dad was on a business trip, because otherwise Drew’d say, “Isn’t Dad home?”<span>&nbsp; </span>Well, he never actually said that, I was just afraid he would.<span>&nbsp; </span>What Drew would really say was: “What was it about?”<span>&nbsp; </span>And after I told him he’d go, “That’s way less scary than the one about Mom,” which always made me feel better.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">The one about Mom was Drew’s favorite.<span>&nbsp; </span>“The Nightmare of All Nightmares,” he said.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was this dream where I found Mom’s dead body in the yard and I kissed her on the face a bunch of times to try and wake her up.<span>&nbsp; </span>I always had dreams about Mom and she was always a zombie or a ghost or a vampire or something.<span>&nbsp; </span>But in The Nightmare of All Nightmares, she was frozen.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, my lips stuck to her like when that kid licks the pole in “A Christmas Story”, except when I finally got the guts up to pull my own lips off, I couldn’t.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s when I realized I’d have to be there, kissing her forever.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I remember I heard that if you think about something right before you go to sleep, that’s what you’re going to dream about.<span>&nbsp; </span>And so I always thought about Drew and Ellie as hard as I could. I figured if I could dream about them, then at least I wouldn’t be by myself when things got scary.<span>&nbsp; </span>It didn’t work really.<span>&nbsp; </span>I mean, sometimes Drew and Ellie’d be in the dream part, but when the actual nightmare happened, it was just me and all the different monster versions of Mom.<span>&nbsp; </span>But see, I wanted them there so bad that I thought maybe if I pretended they’d been there, then it’d be real or something.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I made up a nightmare where Drew, Ellie and me were running away from a murderer and told it to Drew one night when I went in to sleep on his floor.<span>&nbsp; </span>He didn’t really say anything about it, so I tried it the next night, and then a few more times.<span>&nbsp; </span>“It was that one about us again,” I’d whisper seriously, acting all scared.<span>&nbsp; </span>Drew’d just nod, though, and go back to sleep like it wasn’t a big deal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then one time, after I’d told it, like, four times, Drew got kind of angry and said, “That’s not even a nightmare, Kip,” and after that, I went back to telling him the real ones.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;" align="center"><span class="SansSerif">***</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Mrs. Galanis made tacos tonight and told us to eat “quick quick!” because she had to get to her cousin’s house before seven.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, Drew, Ellie and I got to eat standing up by the counter while she did dishes.

</span>For a while there was this one called Car Chase where Drew and Ellie’d hide behind the bushes at the end of the yard, and I’d have to run across the street whenever they said </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>GO</em></span><span class="SansSerif">. The trick was to time it so that it was just when the car was about to whiz past, but not too late, so that I didn’t die.<span>&nbsp; </span>I usually closed my eyes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anyway, we had to stop that one when they sent me out running in front of a police car. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Snowbank Ninjas was our winter game.<span>&nbsp; </span>See, our driveway goes downhill but the yard stays flat so that when you walk down the driveway, the yard part gets more and more above your head.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you walk to the very edge of the front yard it becomes the top of a stonewall that is above the street.<span>&nbsp; </span>We weren’t supposed to go that far when we were little because Dad said we’d fall into traffic (maybe like, two cars went by our house </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>an hour)</em></span><span class="SansSerif">.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we always did Snowbank Ninjas at the part of the yard by the Weeping Willow so Dad couldn’t see.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Anyway, we’d take the kid shovels (those are the plastic ones.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dad never let us use his because he said we’d kill ourselves), and we’d take all the snow around the tree and build a snow wall on top of the actual one.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once it was tall enough to climb and slanty enough so we could slide on it, we’d get the spoons from the kitchen and start the game, which was to lie on our bellies and race up the snow wall without using our legs.<span>&nbsp; </span>The loser got held over the edge of the wall by their feet.<span>&nbsp; </span>The road’s curvy and icy, and we’re in the country so no one comes here unless they live here—which is only us, really, and some old people. So we never got caught until Miss Allen, who was going, like, a hundred miles an hour down our street.<span>&nbsp; </span>She said she was on her way to teach piano, which is a lie.<span>&nbsp; </span>I mean, yeah, Miss Allen’s a piano teacher, but like I said, only old people live by us, and old people don’t take piano lessons, kids do.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, Drew, Ellie and me thought she was intoxicated because her face was so red (but that could have just been from the screaming).</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Anyway, the trick was to use the spoon part of the spoon, but that part was always harder to stick into the snow, so like an idiot I usually gave up and tried to pull myself with the handle, which makes you slide back.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, Drew got up the snow bank first, and won, and then Ellie won second, and then they got to hold me down the snow wall.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wasn’t like, actually hanging because, like I said, the snow bank is slanted, so I was on my stomach against the snow the whole time.<span>&nbsp; </span>But the snow wall was as high as our house, which is one and a half stories, and like always, Drew and Ellie screamed and pretended a car was coming, which made it pretty scary.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Then it happened: Ellie, who’d just gotten new gloves without the grip fingers, accidentally let go of me; Drew was still holding my foot, so he almost fell down too, because, even though I was the youngest, I was wearing a snowsuit, which made me pretty heavy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie couldn’t reach my foot, and Drew couldn’t get it because he was still trying to hold onto the other one, so Drew had to try and hang on while Ellie got on her stomach to pass me spoons.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Stick the spoon part in, Kip!”<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie yelled.<span>&nbsp; </span>“</span><span class="SansSerif"><em>Not</em></span><span class="SansSerif"> </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>the</em></span><span class="SansSerif"> </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>handle</em></span><span class="SansSerif">!”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">But then one of the spoons broke in half and the other one fell on the street and I started all crying with my face against the snow and my foot in Drew’s hand.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie, who was brave back then from getting kicked so much, took off her gloves and climbed down next to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>My head was down by her ankles, but I could see that she’d dug her fingers into the snow and they’d turned bright red.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“</span><span class="SansSerif"><em>Drew</em></span><span class="SansSerif">, help!”<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie screamed.

</span>Drew’d even gotten a foot grip on the snow bank and was just about to push me up by my butt.<span>&nbsp; </span>But then he started slipping because he didn’t have his boots on.<span>&nbsp; </span>He tried to grab onto me to save himself, and I grabbed onto Ellie, and all of us went crashing into the street.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">That part wasn’t </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>so</em></span><span class="SansSerif"> bad.<span>&nbsp; </span>I scraped my face a lot on the ice at the bottom, but I didn’t die like I thought I would.<span>&nbsp; </span>When we stood up and looked at each other we started cracking up, and then Drew and Ellie hugged me really hard between them, which would have been great if they hadn’t smushed my chapped face against their buttons.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;

text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Flat against the snow, Idiots!”<span>&nbsp; </span>Drew yelled, and we jumped against it like cicadas on a wall—our arms all stretched out above us, and our hands dug in, trying to hold ourselves skinny against the snow.<span>&nbsp; </span>I sucked in my stomach when I heard Miss Allen’s horn, and felt this big wind go up our coats when she whizzed past.<span>&nbsp; </span>She ran over the spoon I dropped, which was Mom’s, but Ellie and me got lucky—not like Drew, who had bruises for months from Miss Allen’s door handle slid across his butt. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;

text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Miss Allen kept talking, but was a little quieter about wanting Dad’s attention. She kept reaching out to touch him and then putting a piece of hair behind her ear instead.<span>&nbsp; </span>“All I’m saying,” she said, all chasing after us, whining like a little kid.<span>&nbsp; </span>“All I’m saying is they’re </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>your</em></span><span class="SansSerif"> kids, and”—she stopped talking when she saw that Dad was about to slam the door. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">We followed him into the TV room, still thinking, I guess, that he might be angry.<span>&nbsp; </span>He sat down on the couch in the TV room and rubbed his eyes underneath his glasses—these could be angry things or tired things, we didn’t know.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we just sort of stood in front of him, all dripping on the carpet. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Sorry Dad,” Ellie whispered.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was always the first to apologize for anything.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dad cracked his knuckles and started tapping his foot, which made the change in his pockets jingle.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Are you really mad?”<span>&nbsp; </span>She asked, but Dad still didn’t say anything.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I started sobbing.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Please don’t be mad at us!”<span>&nbsp; </span>I went and climbed on Dad’s lap and even though I was making his work clothes wet he didn’t say anything.<span>&nbsp; </span>He pulled the sleeve of his sweater over his hand and wiped snot off my face.<span>&nbsp; </span>His mouth was really tight when he reached out for Ellie.<span>&nbsp; </span>He looked scary, then, but she sat down and her and me let him hug us tight on his lap. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Should we take our boots off?”<span>&nbsp; </span>Drew asked, even though he wasn’t wearing any.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dad just stuck his face into my hair and breathed. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Dad has this joke he does where he hobbles and says: ‘I’m an old man, kids, an old man without the mental strength to deal with your antics’, like a grandpa.<span>&nbsp; </span>It isn’t very funny—it never was—but I wanted so bad for him to say it right then.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Dad,” Drew said, “I know you’re always saying that ‘next time’ you’re gonna call the PTA and get us into ‘age appropriate activities’, but I really don’t think this should count, because, see,” Drew put his hands in his pockets, “See, I think it was Miss Allen’s fault, Dad.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Yeah, Daddy,” I said.<span>&nbsp; </span>I pulled on his ear to get his attention.<span>&nbsp; </span>He wouldn’t look at any of us.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Miss Allen had intoxication.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Intoxicat</span><span class="SansSerif"><em>-ed</em></span><span class="SansSerif">,” Ellie whispered.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Dad squeezed us tight. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“She had intoxicated,” I said impatientely and tried to push him out of my hair.<span>&nbsp; </span>His breath on my ear was making me feel funny.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">He pulled all the way away from both me and Ellie, which made me feel guilty, and put his hands in his lap.<span>&nbsp; </span>“I couldn’t have done anything to stop it,” he whispered, and his face got wrinkly—not like an old man, but like one of those fancy dogs whose face is folded like a stack of bath towels. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Dad,” Ellie said.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Dad, don’t be sad, please.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Dad put his face in his hands again and started shaking.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Dad?”<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I tried to pull his hands away but he just dug his face harder into his palms.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Daddy?”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">That’s when the noises started.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sob noises.<span>&nbsp; </span>Big wet, sob noises coming out of our own Dad.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“He’s crying,” Ellie whispered.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Drew took a step back and kicked his shoes off.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Hey Dad it’s okay, I’ll clean up, you don’t have to do anything.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He got down on his knees and started pulling on Ellie’s boots.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“We won’t play there anymore,” Ellie said.<span>&nbsp; </span>“We promise.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Yeah Dad, we promise,” I said.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Drew’d lined up all the boots by the fireplace.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mine were on the end, and one was propped funny by some matches and as soon as Drew stood it up, it would fall and knock over Ellie’s.<span>&nbsp; </span>Drew just kept lining them up again, which made me want to cry for some reason.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“You could even call the PTA if you want,” Ellie said.<span>&nbsp; </span>“There’s a whole list of school activities in my Thursday Folder.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I thought about going up to my room and grabbing my Trapper Keeper, because I had </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>my</em></span><span class="SansSerif"> Thursday Folder too, but just then Dad took his hands off his face. His glasses were fogged but there were tears coming down behind them, and his face was all wet and streaky and stained red.<span>&nbsp; </span>He looked ugly, like a baby that’s about to scream.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Clean his glasses,” Drew whispered.<span>&nbsp; </span>I didn’t want to, but I reached up for them anyway.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dad pushed my hand away really slow.<span>&nbsp; </span>His mouth was a line again, but it was shaking.<span>&nbsp; </span>He motioned at Drew to stop it with the boots.<span>&nbsp; </span>“It’s fine,” he said.<span>&nbsp; </span>His voice was low and wet.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Dad, really, I’ll do soccer, I will.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Gymnastics,” Ellie blurted out.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her and Drew looked at me.<span>&nbsp; </span>I sat down on my hands.<span>&nbsp; </span>I didn’t want to promise those things.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I was scared Dad might stick his face into my hair again.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Susan George’s brother goes to space camp,” I said.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“That’s only two weeks out of the year, Anus,” Drew said.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Well, Ellie’s doing gymnastics even though she has Motion Sickness.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“At least I can do a real cartwheel,” Ellie said.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Probably not without barfing on yourself!”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Then Dad stood up and smoothed out his tie.<span>&nbsp; </span>His pants were wet on the front from my snowsuit.<span>&nbsp; </span>It looked like he’d had an accident.<span>&nbsp; </span>“I’m going to my room,” he said, and left us.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">It was quiet after he left.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bad quiet.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tried to make it better by sticking my tongue out at Ellie, but she just ignored me and started getting off her snow stuff, which Drew put on the bricks next to her boots, which’d fallen for the last time a few minutes before that.<span>&nbsp; </span>My fingers were too small to do zippers, so after he’d undressed, Drew came over and zipped me out.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Try not to get the carpet wet,” he said, even though it was already totally soaked.<span>&nbsp; </span>We stood there in our underwear staring at each other a few minutes and then decided to wait in our rooms.<span>&nbsp; </span>We decided Dad’d forgotten to send us there. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">It took almost 30 minutes for anything to happen.<span>&nbsp; </span>But then Dad got on the phone, first with the builders, talking about putting a shower and toilet in our basement, and then with some moms from the school directory, asking about “appropriate activities for eight, eleven and twelve year-olds.” Moms from school were always telling Dad what to do with us, but he never asked them for help until right then.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“It’s my fault.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I whispered.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie shook her all-wet face and said, “I should have worn the good gloves.”<span>&nbsp; </span>We didn’t say anything about Dad crying in the TV room.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">After a while, Dad started making Fish Stix in the kitchen, but he didn’t call out “Dinner” and so Ellie and me just sat on her bed for a while, not talking or anything.<span>&nbsp; </span>It wasn’t like we were saying goodbye right then, even though that’s what it seems like now.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just don’t think we were ready to leave yet.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“We’ll leave when the clock says six,” Ellie said, and I nodded.<span>&nbsp; </span>After a while, we knocked on the wall to see what Drew was doing.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Shave, and, a, hair, cut?<span>&nbsp; </span>We asked. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;

</span>There was supposed to be a Fresh Prince marathon, but I must have read it wrong, because there was just baseball.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I decided to drink some milk on the roof and then maybe see if Drew wanted to play Mortal Kombat.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">You can get on the roof if you go through Ellie’s window, which used to be both of our window.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dad and us used to go out there with a blanket to watch fireworks every fourth of July.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not scary because pretty much the whole house is ranch-style, which means the roof is flat.<span>&nbsp; </span>But of course Ellie’s in her room all the time, so if I want to go on the roof I have to climb the tree outside the TV room, which is hard to do if you’ve got a glass in your hand.<span>&nbsp; </span>After a while you get used to it, though.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trick is to have long toes and go barefoot so that you can hold on with your feet. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Anyway, it took like, two seconds to get up there.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s when I heard someone coughing.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Drew?”<span>&nbsp; </span>I whispered.<span>&nbsp;

</span>He yelled.<span>&nbsp; </span>I couldn’t see him, but he was totally sitting on the slanted part of the roof by Dad’s room, I could tell.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, I started walking there.<span>&nbsp; </span>I took a sip of my milk so it’d be harder to spill. “It’s my house too,” I yelled.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Drew was wearing his soccer sweatshirt, sitting all hunched over right where I guessed he’d be.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“You smell like butt-crack,” I said, even though it was more like a skunk.<span>&nbsp; </span>He had a lighter in his hand.<span>&nbsp;

text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Can I have some of your milk?”<span>&nbsp; </span>He poked the side of my glass with his lighter.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“If I can play with your lighter,” I said.<span>&nbsp; </span>We passed them to each other.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;

</span>Drew sighed.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Maybe he thought it’d be weird if he got rid of everything but the spoons.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He picked a mosquito bite off his foot.<span>&nbsp; </span>“And I can’t believe that’s the only thing you noticed.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was at it all night finding stuff.<span>&nbsp; </span>He threw away your entire fucking key collection.”<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;

</span>But then I wondered if wanting to kill the people who’d hurt Ellie was the wrong way to make things better. It’s what I’d want if I were her, but maybe Dad and Drew were right.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe trying to love somebody just meant wanting them not to die.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anyway, it was too much to figure out right then.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was really only one thing to say: </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“What a big fat stupid </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>bit</em></span><span class="SansSerif">—“</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">Drew knocked me in the chest with his elbow.<span>&nbsp; </span>“I think I hear something.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Ellie’s radio went off.<span>&nbsp; </span>“We got her,” Drew giggled, and shook me like I’d helped him win something.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">I heard Ellie stomp around a little inside her room—just heavy, though, not pissed or anything—and then her screen went up, like, </span><span class="SansSerif"><em>bam</em></span><span class="SansSerif">.<span>&nbsp; </span>She stuck the top part of herself out and twisted to look at us.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Oh.<span>&nbsp; </span>My.<span>&nbsp; </span>God.”<span>&nbsp; </span>She said.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just like that, all slow. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Hi Ellie,” Drew said.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 120%; vertical-align: middle;"><span class="SansSerif">“Hi Ellie,” I said.<span>&nbsp; </span>Drew and me started cracking up. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span class="SansSerif">“Hi weirdos.” Ellie put a hand on the roof pull herself out.<span>&nbsp; </span>She wasn’t smiling, but she looked like she was about to.<span>&nbsp; </span>I started shaking like Mrs. Galanis—like I’d had two Pepsis instead of just milk.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s how excited I was.</span><span class="SansSerif"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></span></p></div>
