<title>Pieces of a Man | Jesse Nee-Vogelman | Fiction</title>
<meta name="author" content="Jesse Nee-Vogelman">
<meta name="description" content="Though Katherine wanted to be a woman, wanted to butterfly out bright and kaleidoscopic onto the streets fully formed, complex and multitudinous, she found herself, upon each insistent inspection of her body, solidly still a girl. She blamed her mother, a girl’s mother, a sad mother, a mother who will remain for the rest of her life postpartum. She blamed her body, a girl’s body, and her clothes, still and girlish in her closet.">

She blamed her mother, a girl’s mother, a sad mother, a mother who will remain for the rest of her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">life postpartum. She blamed her body, a girl’s body, and her clothes, still and girlish in her closet. In the formless&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">dresses and little blouses she saw herself, the small tender swell of her breasts, the smooth slender fall of her hips&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">into her thighs, an unblemished line, a child’s thin lips, a child’s thin arms, the girlish curls that unfurled blonde&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and bouncing from her forehead, and the odd dark tuft of hair a few inches below her navel, out of place and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">offering futile promises of nubility. She blamed her love, a girl’s romance planned in passed notes and notebook&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">graffiti hearts, a romance that at fourteen had felt safe, and now, at fifteen, felt safer.<br /></span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>And even though her house predated her by some years, Katherine still considered her home a girl’s home.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The house sat alone atop a hill, covered on one side by a small forest of dark fir trees. A winding grey scar divided&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">the forest in two, a gravel road connecting the house to a private beach. Isolated above the forest, smoke puffing&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">out of the cobbled chimney, the breeze carrying salt from the ocean, it was less a house than a story, a girl’s fairy&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">tale into which some strange hand had written her.<br /></span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Even before she turned fifteen, the desire to leave grew in her. She began walking, reaching places only to find&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">them immediately foreign and strange. Her boyfriend’s home no longer held anything for her except unwanted&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">security and uncomfortable promises. It was a place where parents discussed weddings behind closed doors and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">tiny lovers discovered their tiny bodies with increasing boredom and respect behind their own doors. As she lay in&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">his bed, her boyfriend’s head on her near nonexistent breasts, she would take his hands in her own, pull strands&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">of her hair from the band of his watch. She would look at both pairs of hands, folded neatly together, and think,&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">these are not the hands I want to spend the rest of my life with, neither his, nor mine.<br /></span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She became a girl always in transit, moving between people and friends with an abandon that confused and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">frightened her. She longed for some ineffable stability, dreaming hard and solid dreams, dreams of bodies and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">muscles and empty houses and cars driven by strong, unfamiliar hands. She dreamt of her father. Every day he&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">drove her to school and every evening he picked her up, letting her out of the car and into the house, and she&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">would go into the kitchen and peek out through the blinds and watch her father sit alone in the car and long for&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">a place of her own, wondering why those moments of silent familial voyeurism seemed to her the most beautiful&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">in the world.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 12.65pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>At fifteen and a half her father took her to get her driver’s permit at the DMV two towns over, and when she&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">passed the test he brought her home to find a present in the driveway, an old orange Volkswagen bus.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt; white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">Feel free to leave, he told her, and smiled. Just don’t get caught.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She drove to the beach, stopping only because she could go no further. Through the windshield the sea&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">stretched out before her. She felt the uncomfortable settling of her eyes on the horizon, the sheer size of the&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">distant line, like thin twine that tied the world together. Dirt and small cracks in the glass speckled and tinted&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 12.65pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">the ocean like a dying television set. The waves rolled thick and vicious in the edgeless distance. She pressed her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">hands to the worn glass. She kept her hands there. She looked at the waves and when they did not crash over her,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">she stepped out of the car.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt; white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">On the beach she and the Volkswagen bus stood alone. She leaned her hand on the side of the door and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">removed her shoes and socks, placing them next to the wheel, already submerged in sand and dust and rusting&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">from the salty air. She curled her toes against the earth, squeezing the small fragments in the soft empty spaces of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">her feet, feeling the sand trickling between her toes.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She left the bus and walked towards the break. Tiny footprints followed her down towards the water. Little&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">fossils in the sand. How small they were, pressed too shallow to possibly be her steps, to possibly have borne her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">weight.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Water brushed her toes. She stepped further into the ocean, submerging herself in increments, her toes, the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">balls of her feet, her heels, her ankles, her slender shins. The tide held her, rushing forward to embrace her and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">sliding back into the sea, pulling with it the loose pebbles around and under her feet. She thought about the earth&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">bleeding away beneath her. Salt and quartz rubbed raw from underwater rocks, crushed sea shells and mollusks,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">decayed algae, odd bits of life ground into dust. How easy it would be to go with them, for the ocean to hold on&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">to her feet and pull them clean from her ankles away into the sea. How easy to rip her into little pieces, joint by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">tiny joint rubbed away in the waves leaving only even tinier bits behind, particles of a shell joining the others&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">broken in the sand.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>How odd, she thought, to stand there, whole, and be anything at all.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>The sun set. Violent reds and remote violets streaked across the darkening day. Screeching gulls became bugs&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">swarming in the warm air. She checked her phone. Her boyfriend had called four times, her mother not at all.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>At the beach in the bed of the old Volkswagen she lay down and cried and imagined herself to be her mother&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">in bed, immobile, and infinitely far away, an adult and, like her daughter, still a little girl.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She began going to the beach every day, coasting the old Volkswagen down the hill and through the forest&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">until she hit the sand and the bus slowed to a stop. Alone on the beach Katherine forgot herself. Every night&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">she would undress and lie in the sand and let the surf play over her bare body, feel its cold fingers find her most&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">intimate places. She lay there until she lost feeling in her toes and knuckles, until her skin darkened and her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">joints froze stiff. Then, she would rise and dress and return to her car and fall asleep, holding herself in her arms&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and wondering whom she was becoming.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 12.65pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>One day she found something strange. The beach lay quiet and the surf bobbed in and out, leaving little gifts&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">for Katherine just past the edge of the water. She picked them up and held them, bits of shell and rock and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">broken bottles saved from a future of sand. Walking along the swash, she saw something in the distance, a dark&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">lump peeking out of the sand. She approached it and stopped and kept going, looking at the pinkish thing in front&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">of her, a pinkish thing that had no place lying there on her beach, and certainly no business lying there alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">She stood over it and poked with a piece of driftwood, turning it over and over until she finally had to admit that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">yes, there on her beach lay a human foot.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>The foot was big. A men’s size twelve, she would have guessed. Pale blonde hair covered the top of the foot&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and little curly tufts puffed off the knuckles of its toes. The heel was square, its nails well manicured, cut short,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and the skin looked soft and smooth despite the foot’s time in the ocean. The foot ended just above the ankle,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">cut clean across, and a small nub of white bone poked out of the top. She turned around, looking for some sign&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">of the foot’s origin, a corpse or a scream, or even another foot, but the beach lay empty. She lifted her own foot,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">hesitated, and touched the foot with her toe. It was still warm. Behind the skin the meat of the foot pulsed red&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and wet, the fresh flesh almost oozing, veins almost pumping out thick rich blood so that the foot appeared alive&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and Katherine nearly expected it to right itself and hop away down the beach.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 12.65pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>She went home early that night and ate dinner with her parents for the first time in several weeks. As she stared&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">down at her meal, a cut of pork loin, thick, pink, and juicy, which her dad had prepared just for her, she could not&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">help but remember the foot. She could not help but see its supple flesh on her plate, the hunk of meat narrowing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and elongating before her, dividing into five little toes that curled around her unused fork, begging her to pierce&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">the fleshy ball of meat under its heel.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She excused herself and went to bed without eating, leaving her parents confused at the table. Upstairs in bed,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">Katherine called her boyfriend for the first time in three days.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>How are you? he asked.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She hung up the phone.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>He would not know how to handle the foot on the beach. He would tell her parents. He would call the police.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">He would comfort her and tell her to forget the foot and to leave the beach. He would not understand it was her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">beach, and by extension, her foot. A sudden desire seized her, an uncontrollable urge to break open his chest&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and see with her own eyes what filled him. Did there exist within him worries beyond their two hands, or the</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">occasional togetherness of their lips? Or would she find simple flesh and blood?</span></p> <p style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 12.65pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>The next day she skipped school and returned to the beach. She worried about the foot and hoped it had<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">disappeared, but, at the same time, Katherine was happy to have something to worry about other than herself.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">But this time the foot was not alone. More body parts had washed ashore and joined the foot on the beach, all<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">clustered together as if huddling for warmth, as if they had found each other after a long lonely voyage. A nose<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">caught her attention first, long and thin and pinched at the bridge, pointy with wide nostrils and tiny curly hairs<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">that stuck wiry out of the holes. The thin hairs blew gently in the sea breeze, so that it seemed as if the little<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">discorporate nose still breathed, pushing oxygen to some unseen body. An arm lay next to it, darker in color than<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">either the nose or the foot, speckled with brown freckles, coarse hair, but clearly feminine, slender lilting wrists,<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">tapered forearms. She saw a chest too, a man’s chest, wide and bright, light skin and hard dark nipples, well<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">defined abs cutting the stomach into compact sections of muscle. They all lay there splayed before her, spectral<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and carnal, missing pieces from missing wholes.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>The sea bit her eyes and stung her cheeks. The water washed over her feet, still attached solidly to her ankles.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">She felt her chest and her arms and her legs, all connected together. The wind swung her hair in a lilting waltz&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and it fell over her eyes, covering her world in curly yellow lines. But when her hands swept the strands from her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">face the body parts still lay there in the sand, the still pieces of men.</span></p><p style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 12.65pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>More body parts washed onto the shore, and more the day after that. Each day Katherine returned to the beach&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and watched the legs and the torsos and the ears and ankles float onto the sand and join the growing pile of limbs&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and flesh. She told no one, and saw her family less and less. Her father thought she was going to her boyfriend’s&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">house, her boyfriend thought she was taking care of her mother, her mother thought Katherine had finally&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">become like her and given up. Katherine kept up appearances, going to school, kissing her boyfriend, kissing her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">father, telling her mother they were both fine, her mother telling her they were not.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Every day she returned to the beach and watched the pile of loose body parts grow. By the end of the week they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">had filled the beach, eyes and the eyelids, buttocks and knuckles and knees and ankles strewn across the sand,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">thousands of limbs piled high and wide, more floating onto the shore every hour. Infinite combinations of bodies,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">infinite combinations of people.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 12.65pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She began to build. It started with a thigh, thick and muscular, strong smooth quad rising up behind the skin,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">which was peach and soft, covered in a soft apricot fuzz. She held the thigh in her hands, surprised by its weight,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">by its density, how it filled and completed the open palm of her hands. She set the thigh down away from the pile&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">of body parts, and saw the small ghostly marks of her fingers, clawing white lines on the pink skin.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt; white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">She chose an arm next, and then a chest, and a pair of feet and large old eyes, and knees, long dextrous fingers,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">thick muscled fingers with hair on the knuckles, cheeks and lips with small wrinkles around and below the mouth,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">unexpected attractive grooves that held her and held her, changed an arm, picked a forehead, switched the feet,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">now larger and clumsier, chose hair long and wild and dirty, chose a stomach, beautiful with a long rippled scar,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">creased knotted skin that stretched across and through its navel, which was round and shallow, picked ears, chose&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">new ears, building and building, picking and choosing the pieces, feeling and finding more intimate places, firm&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">buttocks, a groin, places she had felt before in the dark, but never seen, both she and her boyfriend ashamed of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">their small developing bodies, but in this body developing before her she felt no shame, in this body she saw only&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">the potential of perfection, the potential of one beautiful solid body among infinite imperfect ones, the potential&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">of a body of her own so completely not her own body, a body alluring and whole and frightening, the body of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">a man, sturdy and worn, wearing the signs of life, scars, wrinkles around the eyes, changed a leg again, longer,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">taller, stretching out and beyond her, out and beyond her busy building hands.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>When she finished she realized he was older than she had expected, probably over twice her age. She took off&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">her clothes and lay down next to him naked in the surf like she used to do at night when she was alone, and she&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">looked at their two bodies together. She placed her feet next to his and stretched herself alongside him, feeling&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">the curve of his thigh, the muscle of his back, the empty spots between his wide ribs, and his shoulders and neck&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and head, which stretched past her own head, perhaps a foot longer or more. They lay there together for some&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">time, growing cold together in the swelling ocean, the sand and surf playing up and down their frames. She&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">sighed and placed a hand on his chest. Its warmth surprised her, as well as the small rhythmic movement of his&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">breast, probably caused by the pulse of the waves. She pressed her hand down hard and gripped his chest, holding&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">as much as she could with her small hand, until another hand closed softly down on hers.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 12.65pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Her breath stopped. Her heart stopped. The whole of her body froze in that moment, the collapse of hand onto&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">hand, the twining of fingers, the shared pulse of two separate hearts meeting in their palms. He stood, unfolding&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">himself into the twilight, his long solid body taking up more space than she believed possible. For the first time&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">Katherine became aware of their nakedness, the shame of exposure and the strange intimacy of their bare bodies&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">together. She took him in, for the first time, as a whole, not the sum of chosen parts, but a body and a being&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">separate from her own. She looked at his groin and covered her breasts.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt; white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">I need to go, she said, and he nodded at her.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt; white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">Then go.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>His voice, impossible and loud, stretched out into the night like a deep siren, a primal pulse that hit her hard&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">in her exposed chest. She did not expect that voice, that rich old hungry voice, that penetrating voice that struck&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">deep into her heart and the back of her knees.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 12.65pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Then go, he had said, and she wanted to go. She wanted her home. She wanted her mother and her father&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and even her boyfriend. She wanted familiar arms to embrace her, not these great trunks, hard muscular arms&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">that split from this man like tree branches, arms that could crush her small girlish body into its tiniest parts. He&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">touched her hand and held it and pulled it away from her chest and she didn’t move. He touched her other hand&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and held it and pulled it away from her chest. They stood there like that as the sun fell behind the horizon until&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">she could no longer see him, he holding her hands in front of her, like a guide pulling her forth into the night.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 12.65pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She stayed away from the beach for a few days, working herself back into the life she had started to leave&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">behind. She ate at home, saw her boyfriend, expressed worry about her mother, frowned in the mirror. But even&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">alone, just behind each action stood the man she had built on the beach. She saw him in flashes at school, caught&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">his eyes in mirrors, saw his arms in crowds, heard his voice in the murmurs of students and shopkeepers. Then&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">go, she heard him say over and over, his voice made wide and infinite in memory. Go, she thought, then go.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">On the night of her sixteenth birthday she returned to the beach, the large pile of body parts looming&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">in the distance as the bus pulled up onto the sand. There he stood, bare and beautiful. He faced the open&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">ocean, which lapped hungrily at his feet, as if desiring to pull him back into the sea and reclaim his beautiful&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">body as its own. She walked down the beach and stood next to him, and he smiled at her with old knowing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">lips, and they said nothing to each other for some time.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Aren’t you cold? she asked him.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>No. Are you?<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>No.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>He held out his hand and she took it and they watched the ocean together, the waves beating and pulsing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">with their own hearts. The sun set. The earth darkened.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>I should go, she said.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Then go, he said. And she did.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She came back every day to be with him, finding it more difficult to return home each night. They walked&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">together along the beach, sometimes holding hands, sometimes not, sometimes talking, often silent. When&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">they talked they rarely spoke in conversation. Rather, they took turns listening to each other. She told him&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">about her fears and worries, about her mother and her boyfriend and her body. She asked about him, but he&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">only told her about other things. He spoke of love and desire, of the sea and the waves, of bodies and sex and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">fear and yearning and hope and hopelessness. There on that beach she wondered if it were possible to speak&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">in anything less than grand statements and fantastic truths. She wondered if there was anything that he could&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">not explain to her with fullness and beauty.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She begins skipping school. She begins forgetting her other world, and imagines that it forgets her. Every&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">morning she drives to the beach, each night she drives home later and later. When she arrives, he undresses&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">her, exposing her soft body to the day. He looks at her, and she at him. With her boyfriend she always dressed&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">quickly when they finished, turning her back as she slips on her shirt, putting on her underwear under his</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">blankets. The man on the beach takes her in his hands, traces the lines of her body, guiding her down his&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">chest, learning her body, the sensitive hidden spots, the inner lip of her thigh, the back of her neck, the curl&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">of her ears, the soft spot between her navel and her groin, and the lines below that, delicate and swollen and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">tender and new. Her hands discover the body they built, lingering on his chest, the soft skin just below the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">knot of pelvic bone, moving to envelop his body with her own, possessing him with her flesh, learning for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">the first time the rapture of bodies.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She keeps skipping school. Her teachers call but her mother doesn’t answer and her father stays late at&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">work. Her boyfriend calls her and she ignores him. Over time her phone rings less and less frequently, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">the time between calls weighs on her, though she never answers. Why aren’t they calling? She throws her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">phone into the sea. On her small arms and small legs and small breasts she feels the shame that drove her to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">the beach, the shame she must relearn every time she enters her bus and drives home. She tells this to the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">man on the beach, gushing her envy of his body.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Don’t you understand? she asks him.<span style="white-space:pre"> </span><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She takes his chest in her arms, which barely stretch around his chest, and presses her cheeks into his&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">flesh.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>I want to be like you.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>He looks at her, and speaks slowly, flexing the upper palate of his mouth, his tongue, stretching the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">muscles in his lips.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Then change, he says, If you want, you can change yourself.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>So she does. She hunts through the old forgotten pile of body parts lying on the beach, tearing through&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">thin legs and wide wrists, still fresh and warm, the pile moist with sweat, choosing the future pieces of herself.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">Small things at first, a long pair of eyelashes, slender blue fingernails, trading away the hidden corners of her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">body. As she extricates herself from the pile of limbs she is surprised at which arm is hers. She turns around&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">and the man watches her, carefully inspecting her body.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>How do I look? she asks him.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She returns home, testing the changes in the shine of the faucet, her face in the downstairs windows.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">Behind her transparent nose and eyes she sees her father pull up outside their house. She watches him from&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">behind the blinds and for a moment feels like her old self, loves her boyfriend, loves her mother, upstairs&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">crying, loves her life which she knows just needs more time, just needs a little more time. Her father gets out&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">of the car and walks towards the house and suddenly she knows. She knows that her father will take one look&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">at her and see it all, see the strangeness in her, or worse he won’t even recognize her, he’ll scream at her and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">ask, where is my daughter, who are you, where is my daughter? The door opens and closes, revealing her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">father, standing there looking at her.

Katherine stares at her mother who lays still on her side and doesn’t move&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">despite the creak of the hinges or feet stepping across the floor. She can hear her mother breathing. Whether&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">she is awake or simply crying in her sleep, Katherine can’t tell.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">She turns to leave, and just as she reaches the door she hears something.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>I understand, says her mother, why you’re never here. I’m not angry. If I were you, I would have left too.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">Back in her bus, Katherine curls up in the back seat to sleep. Time passes and the sun crests the hill,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">providing just enough light to see by as she coasts the bus back down the hill to the beach, where her man&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">stands waiting, watching the unending ocean.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Are you happier? he asks, not looking at her.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>No, she says. But I’m less sad.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>He takes her hand. As he leads her to the pile, footprints bleed out behind their feet. The two sets of prints&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">step together, intertwining as if in conversation, like two dancers together in a great hall far away. Together&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">they comb through the potential parts of her, choosing the body she always imagined. A body built of stolen&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">images, a collage of limbs, a kaleidoscopic stranger. He tries to help at first, choosing large full breasts, soft&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">flowery thighs, picking for Katherine a body she doesn’t recognize, pouty rose lips, large almond eyes, but&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">soon Katherine’s fervor outstrips him, and she pores through the piles of hair and flesh, losing herself in her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">own desire for self, rejecting his offers of hourglass hips or sleek black hair for the wavy brown locks of a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">beautiful girl who flirted with her boyfriend in their English class, the voluptuous arms of a woman she once&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">saw on a bus, a mismatched quilt of bodies made beautiful by the paintbrush of memory.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Days pass as she rebuilds herself, perfection takes time. After that first night at home, she has been careful<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">to avoid her reflection. Ghostly ripples of skin in the water, her face in the hubcap distended and bent like a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">swollen kidney. She fears the new high cheekbones, the rounded nose, which she can’t stop feeling with her new,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">large hands. The parts of her body no longer know each other.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She hasn’t seen her parents in some time, returns home in her bus only in the dead of night to steal food. Every&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">time she returns home she expects to see signs of panic, “Missing” posters, and crumpled tissues, or a missing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">placemat on the dinner table, or her boyfriend asleep on the couch, clutching his phone to his chest, waiting&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">for a call that will never come. She imagines his familiar childish body, the round cheeks, and wide, smooth&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">forehead. Before she even finishes dialing she regrets calling him, and each ring sounds forever in her new ears,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">high-pitched roiling clicks, has the phone always sounded like this?<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Hello?<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>He sounds calm. She hears no worry in his voice, no sign that he has been crying or lonely. She listens to him&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">breathe, small smooth streams of air, calm nose breathing, not the rough pitchy mouth sighs of despair. She&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">hangs up the phone and closes her eyes and walks to the bathroom, relearning the way with her new hands and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">new legs. Tracing the lines of her house, each new sensation fills her with an alien recognition, as if her fingers&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">are covered in wax. She opens her eyes.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>To her surprise, she recognizes herself. The eyes in the mirror are not hers, nor are the cheeks, nor the hair,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">nor the chin, nor the skin. Yet, despite their individual foreignness, the little parts make up a face she recognizes&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">indisputably as hers. She knows this face, she has seen it before. She always thought there would come a point&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">where she had to choose between her new self and her old one, that her old life would fight for her, that her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">transformation would climax with a dramatic choice of identity. She had prepared for this. She had steeled&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">herself against it. But the face doesn’t seem foreign. It seems friendly. She would talk to this person on the street.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">If there had been a climax, it happened without her.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She leaves for the bus, returns to the beach and the man and the pile of body parts washing up on the shore.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Nothing there has changed. He stands there, waiting and watching the ocean. He sees her and his mouth&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">twitches in recognition. His lips are the same. He takes her in his arms, which she chose. The arms are the same.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">Are you happier? he asks.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>No, she says, but I’m less sad. I’m less everything.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>You’re more, he tells her.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She hugs his body with her new arms, holding his chest to her new breasts, large and beautiful and boring. The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">earth under her feet feels wet and crisp, tiny drops of water squeezed between tiny grains of sand.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">You’re almost done, he says. You’re so close.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>He lets her out of his arms, the arms she chose so long ago, and walks to the pile of body parts strewn along the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">shore. He bends over and rifles through the pile and stands up, holding something dark in his hands. He holds it&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">out to her, large and full, a red beating heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">This is it, she realizes. She looks at the heart as it pulses in his hand. She thinks about her old world, her home&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">on the hill, no longer her home, her parents, no longer her parents, her boyfriend, no longer her boyfriend, her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">body, no longer a body at all, no longer a problem, no longer anything to her. And she thinks about her new&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">world, her new body, her womanly body and this manly body across from her, and she takes the heart. The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">muscles jump in her hands, constricting in sections, beating just once.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Two seconds pass between the last beat of her first heart and the first beat of her new heart, dead. She can feel&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">the blood course through her, new blood, new oxygen carried to new parts. She waits. He looks at her expectantly.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She feels expectant. What are they waiting for? What signal will they recognize? Nothing. She touches her hand&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">to her neck and runs her fingers down her throat to the knotty bone in her collar down her chest to her breast, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">stops, feeling the gentle subdermal pulse, like an unending tide. A heart is just a heart, a leg just a leg.<span style="white-space:pre"> </span></span></p> <p style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 12.65pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>There must be something else, she says, and runs to the pile. There must be something else.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Katherine, he yells after her.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>No, she says, don’t call me that, please don’t.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She changes everything she can. She replaces herself over and over, trying six pairs of arms, fifteen different&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">pairs of feet, but none of them fit, none of them feel right or wrong, they just feel like feet. She turns around to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">show the man, but his lips tighten and the muscles in his cheek contract into hard knots.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>You did this, she tells him. This is your fault.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>No, he says.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>You’re beautiful. What am I?<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Beautiful, he tells her, but it no longer matters.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Then why did you make me change? she screams. Why did you make me?<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>As he stumbles back away from her, she is surprised at the force of her new adult arms. She is surprised by the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">clumsiness of his body, before so graceful, and she is surprised by the hurt she sees on his face. They look at each&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">other and she sees the ocean behind him grow and swell, and she pushes him again deeper into the water, deeper&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">into the waves, and he makes to move towards her, raises his arms, opens his mouth to speak, but anger burns in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">her new cheeks, and when a wave rises behind him she has the time for just one thought before it comes crashing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">down, a surprising, who is really betraying whom?, before the water crashes into his beautiful shoulders, knocking&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">him down on his knees and into the sand.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>No, not onto his knees, off of his knees. There, next to him, floating in the ocean, lay his legs, strong and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">muscular and disembodied. He looks at his legs, surprised to see them floating there next to him, until another&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">wave hits, pulling his arms from his thick torso, thrashing him, dismantling him, unmaking him, ripping his&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">surprised lips from his surprised face, stripping his eyes from his head, undoing everything that once made him&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">a man. She is amazed how quickly it ends.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She looks at the once body in the water, the pieces of a man. She runs back to the pile and claws through it,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">looking for the old pieces of herself, but flesh blends into flesh, hair into skin, muscle into muscle, she sees an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">arm she recognizes, tries to crawl to it through a sea of limbs, wet and permeated by the ocean, loses the arm in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">the pile, sees a nose, or is it that nose over there? or this one? and under that torso, a hand she recognizes, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">she dives through the flesh and sand, and grabs for the hand and she hears a screech behind her and dives to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">avoid a great white bird, a seagull that swoops and flies away with a familiar hand in its beak. She searches longer,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">finds nothing, and finally she stops. Looking up the beach at the bus parked in the sand and the forest and the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">gravel path to her house, she imagines she can see her home, though she knows she cannot, and she imagines&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">the yellow lights in the window and small blurry shadows of people moving about the rooms, setting the table for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">dinner, lying in bed, and walking down the stairs for dinner every day, going to work, reading.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">She walks back to the ocean. She remembers the first foot on the beach, the great potential of a single foot.<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;"><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>She climbs into the water and stands amidst the destroyed body of the man she built. The surf pounds, throwing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">his limbs, grinding his flesh, now beginning to melt away. Ground into dust, broken into pieces, pulled into the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">sand beneath her. She floats there hoping the waves will find her, will pull her apart too, break her into pieces,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12.65pt;">but she floats there, unhappily whole, still she floats there, still she floats.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
