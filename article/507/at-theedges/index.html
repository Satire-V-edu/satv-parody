		<div><p class="BodyA" align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="BodyA">My uncle once told me about the angels in his bedroom. From the ceiling fixtures, they fell, and hid like moths under the rumpled red curtains of his apartment. In a lamp shade edged brown with age, atop the blue stripes on his duvet, scattered about the darkness that dripped to each corner of the room those same sad mornings someone else left him. He would shake them from his pillowcase and dust them from his hair, and sometimes, instead, he let the angels gather to give the room more light. It was the spring of 1983, when everyone was dying off&mdash;the desk clerk at Donaldson&rsquo;s, my grandfather&rsquo;s investment partner Frank, a childhood friend, that boy with the pickup truck from high school, my uncle&rsquo;s college roommate, an old boyfriend, a current one, and then the next. It was like that day in the bible when God collected the good ones: up out of their clothes, they fell to heaven, and everyone else wandered behind. When my uncle talks about that time, he brings up fig trees and his old piano, the one he tucked between the bookshelf and bathroom door. I don&rsquo;t know why he thinks about fig trees except that they&rsquo;re there, in his memory, along with a piece of his ex-boyfriend&rsquo;s sweater and a box of old gauze. What I remember most though, when I think about what he told me, is the staircase.</p>
<p class="BodyA">He said it happened when he was sleeping. I don&rsquo;t know whether it was in his sleep or whether he woke to it, or whether he thought he woke to it but never woke at all. In detail, he describes the movement of the room, the air slipping out from under him like currents from a windmill, as the thousand angels that had been hiding flew out from behind the curtains, from under the lampshade and inside the pillowcase, and coalesced in front of his bed, spiraling towards the ceiling like the voice of a choir. When he speaks to me, I hear all the wings clicking like magnets, one by one. And in front of him, the angels, and all their bodies, formed a staircase&mdash;and here is where I start to lose him&mdash;a circular staircase, alight and reaching and begging to be climbed. He didn&rsquo;t climb it. He stayed in bed.</p>
<p class="BodyA">That winter, he moved to the tip of Cape Cod, where they all wound up eventually, annexed to the very edges, to where the sand dunes swell and fade and swell again. He calls this the story of what dragged him there.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">So when my sister died last summer, I thought back to the stairs and my uncle&rsquo;s light, and how an emptiness grows and sits in your pocket like mold when someone dies, and how all the hollows that once drilled holes in your life seem suddenly like the most substantial thing, and suddenly the holes are what you are holding onto. And the truth is, even though they&rsquo;re nothing, you&rsquo;re okay with it, because at least it&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p class="BodyA">My mother told my brother and me that sometimes young people die, and grief halts only those who let it. But we could feel her sadness when we would sit up against her bedroom wall at night and listen to her talk very quietly into the phone.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to let this define our family,&rdquo; my mother told Noah and me at the funeral reception after everyone had left. We were sitting together in the kitchen and my mother&rsquo;s friend, the last guest, had just gone to the grocery store. Noah sat in a stool at the counter and I dragged my thumb through the sesame seeds leftover in one of the appetizer trays. For the first time, I felt how this was the start to our life now.</p>
<p class="BodyA">My mother turned on the sink and ran her hands under the water. &ldquo;This is not going to be what breaks us,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">It was the kind of summer where the days just barely cemented together, or maybe were entirely cemented together all along: indistinguishable, a clump of hourless days full of minuteless hours. And my brother and I would spend them the way we used to spend the weeks Holly went away to camp her middle school years, when again it was just us two. We would sit on the swing-set at the playground nearby&mdash;Farland Park where Noah used to play t-ball and I had my first real kiss on top of the sledding hill behind the field. Some mornings, we rode our bikes to pick up muffins from the bakery. Our town square used to be nice, but then the state added a piece of highway underneath it, so an overpass now sliced the square in half. There were a bunch of nail salons and some real-estate offices and then not much else besides the muffins. And on the days all Noah and I wanted to do was sit together on the couch and stare at the wallpaper or watch television, our mother would rush in and pull us from the house as if it were on fire, telling us to get outside and <em>do </em>something, which made us only not want to do anything that much more. On those days, to avoid a fight, I drove Noah to the rock-climbing gym in Hyde Park and we would boulder around in the cheaper part of the gym where you didn&rsquo;t need to rent a harness, and toss ourselves down on the mats. We&rsquo;d lie there, looking up, wondering how much longer we could go until our hands got so blistered we could not go anymore.</p>
<p class="BodyA">Really, though, how I remember it all is this: The nights I was the last up, I would sit on the landing of the stairs and look out the big diamond window facing the lawn, and watch my sadness, like moonlight, slide in through the staircase railings, then drop away. I went through a period where I pretended Holly was away at camp again, and she&rsquo;d return in a few weeks, but when that became too painful, I stopped. Barely was I beginning to realize that death was something that stuck.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">It was after this summer that my uncle came to stay.</p>
<p class="BodyA">Late fall, and I was sitting on top of the furnace by the mudroom window, looking out at the streetlight, that dull one in front of our neighbor&rsquo;s driveway. It was low morning. My brother was still sleeping upstairs and my mother was brushing leaves off the porch steps.</p>
<p class="BodyA">At the corner, the headlights of my uncle&rsquo;s station wagon appeared. My mother turned to look at it. Surprises like these sat uneasily with her, the same way sirens would flinch her awake at night.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; my mother asked when he opened the car door. She balanced the broom against the house and hugged him. &ldquo;Have you lost weight?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">Noah came downstairs in spotted pajama pants that dropped inches above his ankles.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Uncle Wyatt is here,&rdquo; I told him. He sat down on the furnace next to me. His knee bumped against mine and I moved my leg. A pause, then I moved it back.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Have you said hi?&rdquo; Noah asked.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; I turned back to the window.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just stopping by,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he wasn&rsquo;t. He was here to stay. Later, I found out from my mother that he had lost almost all his money that summer, and by almost she meant all, and had to give away his home.</p>
<p class="BodyA">It wasn&rsquo;t as if our uncle&rsquo;s addiction wasn&rsquo;t talked about. It was something I always knew about him, and never felt any shame for, ever since I was old enough to understand why some summers we went to Cape Cod and other summers we didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p class="BodyA">At this point, most of his friendships in Provincetown he had soiled. He even had to give his dog away to a woman down the street, which was particularly heartbreaking to Noah. He had loved that dog since the day my uncle brought her home.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That first night my uncle stayed, I watched my mother make dinner while Noah did his homework upstairs and Uncle Wyatt showered. For dinner, my mother added bacon to the mashed potatoes. I knew she was making it that way for her brother.</p>
<p class="BodyA">At the table, Noah and I sat in our normal seats. While we waited for Uncle Wyatt, my brother reached for the salad.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Noah,&rdquo; my mother snapped. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start yet.&rdquo; He turned red and put his fork back down.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s never been a thing,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rude.&rdquo; She glared at me. Then, she put both her hands out on the table. Noah and I made eye contact across the bread bowl.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; she said. And she made us say grace. We had never said grace before, but we let her lead it. My mother closed her eyes. I stayed staring at Noah as his eyes kept fluttering closed. He was trying to decide whether or not to buy into this. Our mother&rsquo;s faith had been slipping back. We both noticed it. It came in little ways: once at breakfast she lectured us on how the Maasai give mothers only one day to grieve, death then left unassisted. Some afternoons she came back from her walks and told us about the signs she saw in license plate numbers, or the names of new neighbors.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;She and Wyatt were raised Protestant, but she raised us nothing. She used to say she felt closer to God when the four of us caught tadpoles in the high pond or picked small blueberries from the back bushes. The stiffness of a church pew did little for her faith. When I was younger, I collected God in the way my shadow slid along the sidewalk, and in the light that lingered from the nightstand after my mother tucked me into bed. It was a gathering of particles in hidden places that then compiled into some larger thing, often dismissed by others as nothing. And soon, I began to wonder whether it was all made up to make me feel better. And soon after that, I stopped looking.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother called up for Uncle Wyatt. There was no response.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is he still in the shower?&rdquo; I asked. I was getting hungry.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not feeling well,&rdquo; my mother said. She ate a bite of chicken. So Noah ate a bite of his. After, I watched my mother close up the house, locking the back door then pulling out the curtain ties in the living room. The way they fell reminded me of the way my mother used to take barrettes out from my hair at night. She asked me to turn off the kitchen lights.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay up too late,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">I sat for a few more moments. Then I followed upstairs.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">Uncle Wyatt was in the bathroom brushing his teeth. He had a towel around his waist.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rude to come in without knocking,&rdquo; he said, spitting in the sink. He twisted the cap off the toothpaste.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rude to not come to dinner,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Mom made mashed potatoes.&rdquo; He grimaced. Then I added, &ldquo;I thought you showered earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He extracted a razor from the Ziploc bag where he was storing his toothbrush and took my brother&rsquo;s face cream off the shelf. I never realized how many muscles I had in my face until I noticed the way his cheeks slouched inward.</p>
<p class="BodyA">I asked, &ldquo;How long are you staying?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">He smiled. &ldquo;This was a bad one.&rdquo; He shook his head again. He ran a hand down his cheek and the cream slid off into the sink. &ldquo;I might be here awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Giving the dog away was the kicker.&rdquo; He splashed water on his face. We made eye contact in the mirror. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize just how far down the hole my life was until I was handing over the leash to that woman next door. I mean she has two <em>poodles</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Those black ones?&rdquo; I asked. My uncle nodded. &ldquo;We used to see them on the beach sometimes,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He leaned forward to take one last look in the mirror. I wondered what he thought of himself. &ldquo;All yours,&rdquo; he said, snapping the plastic bag back together. At the door, he turned back to me. &ldquo;No where to go now but up,&rdquo; he said and smiled.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="BodyA">One afternoon, I was playing piano when my uncle came in. He stood right behind me. I played Penny Lane, the one song I knew. I liked the way it moved my forefinger over my thumb. I didn&rsquo;t like the way he watching me over my shoulder.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did your mom ever tell you that story about the ghost in our piano?&rdquo; he asked me. I shook my head, but kept playing those same chords, over and over.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;One night at dinner we were all sitting at the table,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;and the piano started playing. I think only your mom and I were home.&rdquo; He paused. His mouth stayed slightly open. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We were eating waffles. And the piano starts playing, so we get scared.&rdquo; His eyes started drifting towards the ceiling. &ldquo;And, I think maybe your mom decided to go check it out or something. It ended up not being a ghost at all, just a mouse running up and down the keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t sure what reaction he wanted, but I stopped playing and looked at him. I wondered where his head was, what part of it was here with me, what part off lost with my mother, and what part was that part always craving something else.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was still staring off when he asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your mom?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Grocery store.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;I hope she picks up those cheese sticks I like.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Those are good,&rdquo; I said. His hand dangled over the piano, above the highest key. Something about seeing him there reminded me. &ldquo;Do you remember the story you told me about the staircase?&rdquo; I asked. But I don&rsquo;t even think he was hearing me. He listened too much to himself. That was what my mother always said.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;The angels in your apartment that time?&rdquo; I tried again. &ldquo;You told me about them when I was younger.&rdquo; I wanted to tell him how much I had been thinking of them. I wanted to ask if he made them up, or if maybe I had dreamed it all on my own. Then, he snapped back.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired of people arguing over whether you&rsquo;re legitimate or not. Have you turned on the TV lately? It&rsquo;s just these stupid fucks who know nothing about you, or anything you are, arguing over whether or not you should exist. And this has gone on. You know how long? Forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. I looked down at the keys. On my wrist, I noticed a small scab. I started picking at it.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Look.&rdquo; The tone of my uncle&rsquo;s voice was different this time. I just wanted him to leave. The scab fell from my wrist and it started to bleed.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Look.&rdquo; Still, I didn&rsquo;t. But when he said it a third time, I turned. My uncle was pointing to a photograph of Holly. It was one from years ago. She was sitting on a wicker chair out by the porch. She was six. A red headband pushed back her hair. &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; The photograph was on a bookshelf by itself.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My shoulders tensed. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your sister,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She blinked.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look.&rdquo; My uncle pointed again. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I wouldn&rsquo;t look. He was walking towards the photograph now. He picked it up. I prayed to God he would not bring it towards me, but here he was.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;See how she blinks?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop it.&rdquo; I wanted to hit him.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Watch. Look!&rdquo; He was looking intently at the photograph. His eyes widened. &ldquo;There. Did you not see her?&rdquo; He thrust the photograph at me. &ldquo;Take it. Take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood up and left.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">That night, I fell asleep thinking about the beach where my uncle, knee-deep in the sea, used to lift me and Holly by the elbows, up out of the water to hop each wave that came. Over its crest, we would fly, our toes barely touching the spray of it. He was getting better. Better and better, I thought. My Uncle Wyatt is getting better. And I slept. And I wondered when it would happen to the rest of us good ones, if ever, or if really it all just stayed the same forever. And then, again, the waves. Did I hop them, up by the elbows? I fell asleep. That year, 1989, that last year that last friend died off, he went to that last place, and the ocean fell in to save him. And the stairs. He climbed them. He was drawn to it: the coves extending far beyond where he thought they could ever go, and the rocks sanded to a smooth skull of rock, puckering with wasps, salted, smoothed, curving as a shoulder into the bay, and he walked across, stepping off into shells and wondering, then, if anyone was watching. No, he said. There was no one.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">I have dreams of my brother dying. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the car door that slices him in half because I close it too fast when we leave for school, his body falling in ribbons to the ground. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the snow that buries him when we go skiing alone down that skinny trail out back. But mostly it&rsquo;s a slow dying, like gas, that takes him into the night, and I&rsquo;m sitting unaware in bed, turning the pages of my book, one wall between us, as Noah slips silently into the dark.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">Christmas came slow. The old cigar man two houses down was late in stringing lights around his windows. When we drove home from school, Noah and I watched him drag plastic reindeer by the antlers across the lawn. Most of them didn&rsquo;t light up anymore. Still, he arranged them delicately. His house pulsed with a dull, graying glow.</p>
<p class="BodyA">We put a wreath on the door with the purple spotted bow Holly used to like, and my mother replaced the pumpkins in our garden with red potted plants. The night before Christmas Eve, Uncle Wyatt came with us to pick out our tree. We took the tall, skinny one, and tied a ribbon around its trunk. Then in the store, Noah started to cry. We all got into the car after that. A freckle-faced boy tied our tree to the top, and my mother slipped the Christmas CD into the player at first, but eventually we drove home in silence.</p>
<p class="BodyA">And then it was Christmas morning. I woke up and went into Noah&rsquo;s room. He was staring out the window.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&ldquo;Move over,&rdquo; I said. He scooted to the side and I slid under the covers. He was wearing his old pajamas, the spotted ones, and looked much younger than he was. His window misted at the bottom. I touched one finger to the glass.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Do you think Mom is still asleep?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wake her soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">Noah agreed. We sat like that for I&rsquo;m not sure how many minutes. The morning turned yellow in the window, and a cardinal landed on a branch of our crabapple tree. For a little bit, we watched it peck at the snowless ground. Then a car drove down our street. The bird flew away.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wake Mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">After we stood at the top of the stairs waiting for Uncle Wyatt to wake up, after the four of us walked downstairs together, after we smiled with appreciation at the tree, and after we had emptied our socks onto the couch and said thank you for each chocolate bar and each knick-knack inside, my mother spoke.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noah and I paused. I had just popped a chocolate into my mouth and was chewing it. My mother was pointing at Noah. &ldquo;There should be something else for you.&rdquo; There was silence in the living room. &ldquo;There should be something else in there, Noah,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;Did you look?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noah was confused. He reached into the stocking. I could see his fingers outstretched at the bottom, groping.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Mom.&rdquo; He laughed uncomfortably. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; More silence. Uncle Wyatt stared at my mother and my mother stared at Noah and I looked at the window. My foot knocked into the andiron, and it clattered against the logs.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wyatt,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My uncle looked taken aback. My mother took Noah&rsquo;s stocking and stuck her hand inside.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mom, stop.&rdquo; I stepped away from the wall. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">She started picking up each one of his little gifts individually&mdash;the chocolate Santa, colored pens, a neon flashlight&mdash;that he had diligently laid out on the coffee table.</p>
<p class="BodyA">Noah spoke quietly. He was standing by the window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;No, honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Please, Mom. It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; She was back at Wyatt now.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Why would you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">I looked at the ground.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Calm down, Meredith.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare.&rdquo; My mother spoke more harshly than I had ever heard. I wanted to leave the room. Noah was looking at me desperately for a cue. I thought of the window in his bedroom. Of the bird and the crabapple tree. Then, I thought of the fig tree, too. And in the living room curtains behind my uncle&rsquo;s back, I thought I saw an angel flutter.</p>
<p class="BodyA">Calmly, my uncle said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you think I took.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;A gift for my <em>son</em>, Wyatt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;Honestly, nothing a seven-year old gets is going to be much use to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s <em>ten</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I watched my uncle stand in front of my mother. I wondered how he stood there, what strength he was drawing upon. Maybe he stood there so still because there was nothing left inside him to risk. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t getting any better at all.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re never here,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re never around. You never help. You selfish bastard.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say anything. My mother started to cry. Her voice did not crack. Her posture did not change. But her face wetted, and I prayed that my uncle would not speak.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&ldquo;My daughter dies and you do nothing. Then you come to me five months later, no house, no money, and I do everything. No more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BodyA">At first, I thought this was one of those moments where nobody breathed, but I could hear my brother breathing, and my uncle, and it soothed and tired me. I let my uncle&rsquo;s breath turn to static and listened just to my brother. I was worried it all might stop. Each breath he took, I held mine for his next.</p>
<p class="BodyA">Was this what happened every time my uncle burned through a friend? This scene of leaving. Maybe family burned through, too. If this was so, I lost faith, then, in my mother. Right there in front of the fireplace, the way she looked at her brother somehow strung me and Noah closer together and distanced her, in a tragic way, from us. I was no fool. What seemed foolish was how my mother could send her brother out the door and still feed us faith on how it all comes back together eventually. The next time she said anything like this to me, I knew something more would be lost between us. Until then, I would wait.</p>
<p class="BodyA">My uncle shrugged and looked at me. His eyes drifted to the piano, the bookshelf, to my brother. Then his eyes dropped and he left.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">My mother threw the Christmas tree out the day after.</p>
<p class="BodyA">This, she always does. She picks all the ornaments off the tree and puts them away in their separate boxes. She vacuums the living room floor. She tells me and my brother to take the tree out with the trash. This year, we rolled the trash bins back up, the plastic bottoms hitting the pavement in steady thumps. She says it is depressing, the needles falling on the living room floor like hair.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">But the lights stay up.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">February, and the lights still dangle from the climbing tree. The red plants stay potted in the garden. The cigar man drags his reindeer back, but our house stays lit, the brightest on the block. Three days we have the tree, barely three, and it lies on the street like a corpse. The smell of pine leaves the living room. Our mother sprays. Our mother cleans. The lights stay up.</p>
<p class="BodyA">My uncle doesn&rsquo;t come back. He will, my mother says. He always does. And again, we feel the heat of some things never changing, and worry some things never will. My brother and I keep biking for muffins, even in the snow. We sit on the mudroom furnace together and pick at our nails. We go outside when our mother gets tense. It&rsquo;s these months that are the hardest. By New Years, my mother finds the gift in the back corner of her closet, the one that was supposed to be in my brother&rsquo;s stocking&mdash;it&rsquo;s a new tie, nice but reasonably inexpensive, and although we would never admit it, the smallness of it is sad. I don&rsquo;t think she ever really thought she lost it.</p>
<p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">Sometime later, I sit in my bed with a mug of tea and hear the nighttime birds coo so deep the sound sits in their throats. Like little crystals, the headlights of cars reflect off the snow edging the road, and fall into my window. Light gathers on my sheets, and I think of my sister. That dull streetlight, I see it from my room. It glows orange through the pines. The house lights flick off downstairs. My hair falls to my shoulders. I listen to my brother breathe next door.</p>
<p class="BodyA">In my mug, the tea bag bleeds.</p>
<p class="BodyA">Through the window, I watch a light dot the top of a hill somewhere South. I used to think it a rocket, then a cell phone tower, but now I think maybe it&rsquo;s her blinking back.&nbsp;</p></div>
