		<div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">On the first day, I told Shadman that his true love left the house every morning at seven thirty three in order to empty the garbage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She stepped gingerly over the double layer of bricks that separated the pavement from her family’s garden, in whose corner there was a trash can where she deposited the remains from last night’s meal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Usually the plastic Key Food bag would leak grease at the bottom and have noodles hanging off the over-stretched handles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At seven thirty seven she’d be outside again in order to lock the door and run around to the front of the house to catch the seven thirty nine bus which carried her to Kings Highway and, I presume, beyond, but I didn’t tell that part to Shadman because it wasn’t part of our promise.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">In school everybody called Shadman “Brown Bear” for all the obvious reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The promise I had with Shadman was for me to tell him one thing about his true love each day while we sat in my backyard doing whatever it was we always did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We were ten then when we started it, but this game went on for a long time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Shadman couldn’t find out about his true love himself of course because he lived 15 blocks east, closer to Flatbush, and she took a bus to school, far away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But she was my next-door neighbor.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">The first time we saw her together was the second time I had seen her, and she was long legged and dark haired enough to make us both turn the corner and hide in the bushes while she was still three houses down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>As she approached we furiously elbowed each other silent, thrashing leaves into each other’s eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I got a thorn stuck in my pinky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When she walked by, head turning neither to the right nor to the left, a scent of crushed wildberries overcame us, and her hair was dark like Shadman’s mother’s, and straight like lines drawn in glass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">The second thing I told him was that his true love was a girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I had started saying this, prefaced by the statement that I was going to say the second thing about his true love, Shadman’s eyes had gone wide like he was about to hear the Word or the announcement of Lebron James’s signing with the Knicks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When he processed what I’d said his eyes got narrow and he hit me hard in the shins with a whiffle ball bat that I’d made heavy with many-colored duct tape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I got angry and instead of telling him about the intricacies of her skin I said that her father wore a button down shirt to work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I saw her father leave for work every morning—he drove.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He came out of the house by the front door, suitcase and tie flying, throwing the papers he was always clutching to his chest into his car through the back window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Shadman’s true love always waved goodbye to her father from the front door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then she would gather her books for the long trip to wherever school was hers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes she would peek her head out the doorframe to eyefollow his vanishing car under the trees and I imagined that she could see me, peeking through the curtains, but of course she never did. Then she’d go take out the garbage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">The third thing I told Shadman was that once, her glasses had fallen off when she went to push her hair back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I told him that when she grinned, the edges of her cheeks went up towards the corners of her eyes, and her eyelashes bounced up and down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I said that she wore a blue bracelet on her right wrist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Number six was that when she was in the shower, she sang “Stitched Up,” the John Mayer song.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was hard for her to keep her voice low and raspy like his, and I imagined her cupping a hand over her mouth to hit the low octaves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Seven turned into a field trip, as I showed him the corner where she got on the bus every morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This was the same corner that was home to the foul pole of mine and Shadman’s home run derbies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For the eighth thing that I told Shadman I said that she was Asian, and he scoffed at me and said he already knew that.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Before I told him the ninth or tenth thing I asked him if he realized that I got the idea for this whole charade from a movie, one of my favorites, in which a shrimpy circus owner tells the actor who plays Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars that he’ll tell him one thing about the girl of his dreams every day as long as Obi Wan repays him in constant servitude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The things that he told him went like this:</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“She like roses!”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Then Obi Wan would say,</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Roses!”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">And repeat the word,</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Roses!”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">while he raked the hay, or cleaned the elephants—“She like roses!”—or stood in the middle of a spherical cage yawning with the whine of high speed motorcycles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In the end the circus owner turns into a wolf, or a bear, or something heavyhaired like that, and relents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s a fairy tale ending of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He tells Obi Wan all about Obi Wan’s true love, and then the story goes on from there, and Obi Wan brings his true love roses and eventually he goes to war and fights Commies and Siamese twins and all that, but at the end he sees his true love again.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Shadman said,</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Right, but what’s the ninth thing?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“She’s a lefty.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Not good enough.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“She only has four toes.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“No way you could know that.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“She has a boyfriend named Athens.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">He pushed me and I fell backwards and my head hit the pole of the basketball hoop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was one of those bumps where a piece of my head swelled into a lump immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I bit my teeth together so hard they went into the wrong grooves and I swung at him from the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I missed.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Don’t say that,” he said, pointing an angry finger at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“You’re making that up.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">The very first time I had seen her I had not been with Shadman and she had been moving in with her parents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Their moving truck was big and purple and said, “We Bump Less” on the bumper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She hopped out of the cab and stumbled a bit over the sidewalk, but caught herself before tripping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She saw that I had noticed and grinned at me, her cheeks collapsing into her eyecorners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My father went up to her father and said, “Hi,” drawing out the ending, as if it meant more than two letters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My mother shook hands awkwardly with her mother which was awkward because my mother hugged everyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My father had on his Firehouse 92, “The Nut House!” t-shirt which he wore every Saturday, and the faded jeans that he put on after one o’clock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Shadman’s true love’s father wore a nice watch and smiled nicely, I thought, and he introduced himself and his petite wife.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“And this,” he said, turning to true love who came hopping up beside him, “is Lily.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Lily!</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">The first time I talked to Lily it was snowing out, even though it was only November.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was the type of snowfall where the best snowball packing snow was on the car windshields.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Shadman and I would have snowball fights with the windshield snow, and when you walked down the street you could see angelfingers on the glass over the dashboards where we had gathered the stuff into clumps and tossed it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I was shoveling my front stoop, waiting for Shadman’s mom to drop him off, when Lily got off the bus at the bus stop on the other side of the street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was one of those days when the street looked only half as wide as it normally did, because the snow was piled up on both sides, and the middle was merrily white, and there wasn’t much slush going black from the smog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It felt like a snowday even though it was the weekend.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Lily saw me from across the street and she smiled at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She waved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She bent down and her hands were fumbling in the snowdrift and I noticed that the buttons on her jacket were robin-blue.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">She was walking towards me with one hand behind her back, and I didn’t see the snowball sticking to her mittens until she was five feet away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When she threw it at me I was too surprised to avoid it, but when she laughed at the kaleidoscope it made on my chest I laughed too, and got her back with a nice firmly packed one right to the thigh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">She laughed while she brushed it off.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“You’ve done a nice job shoveling here,” she said.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“It’s not a big deal,” I said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“I can do yours too if you want.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“No, no, that’s my job.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“That’s what my dad tells me too!”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">She smiled and didn’t answer, so I said, “I like your buttons.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">She looked down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“The blue ones?” she asked.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I nodded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Me too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Blue is my favorite color.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I said that was cool, I liked blue too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Also that it would really not be a big deal at all for me to shovel her front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But she said no, no, that was her chore, and actually she’d better get to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I said well I’ll see you out here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She said it’s a date.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Shadman has a round face and there’re stretch marks on the sides of his belly where the fat came dripping off when he started to play in the community soccer league.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He had always been rolypoly before but now he was skinny and baggy, the folds of his skin like the loose jeans our friends would wear to school, the type that falls down without a belt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Shadman loved soccer, particularly the way they served donuts on the sidelines during halftime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>His mother, who was only adoptively American, would pack sandwiches for him stuffed with rice and barley and pieces of chicken, enclosed in thick rolls of hot bread.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>These would be packaged like sausage links and wrapped in tin foil, and when Shadman’s mother handed them to him at halftime they would tend to be greasy with kitchen oil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Usually I ate them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I could afford to because I played goalie most of the time and stood just outside the net waiting for something to happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My goalie gloves were always greasy from reaching into my pockets and eating bits of the chicken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Once, Shadman tripped in front of the box—he played defense—and the other team’s forward went right past him, just me and him and the ball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I had my right hand stuck in my pocket fingering for the last bit of rice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I almost blocked the shot with my left hand but the ball spun off behind me into the net.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The kid threw his hands up and started running downfield.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Sorry man,” Shadman said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I flipped him off and spit in the grass, rubbed it out with my shoe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I looked behind me instinctively to make sure that Lily wasn’t watching.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes she went for a walk around the park and she’d stop for a second at the soccer games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’d wave from the left goalpost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She’d stop at the midfield out-of-bounds line where all the parents sat, and say hi to Mom and Dad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Once I asked Dad what she says to them and he said “Tuh,” and shook his head towards Mom.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“We talk about great films, Johnny,” he said and rolled his eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Then she’d walk back towards home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I began to notice the way that the back of her neck curved into her shoulders.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">When I get angry at Shadman he knows it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There were often times soon after we’d met Lily when I’d be playing in his backyard and for one reason or another we’d be in a raging fight, and his mother would have to come around, straighten the hair out of her eyes, and yell at us sharply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>How old are you, really?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She’d bring us back inside and make me sit in one corner in a wicker chair while Shadman sat in the opposite corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At first we stared over each other’s heads but then we just looked down at our hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’d trace patterns in the bamboo platform between my legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Eventually he’d start to fake-dance in his chair, swinging his hips back and forth, humming pop tunes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then he’d do the trick with his fingers that makes it look like his thumb is torn in two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I kept ignoring him, he’d whisper, so his Mom couldn’t hear, “but I wanted to be head architect of the fort.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“You were head architect last time!”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“You promised that I could be for two times in a row.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“You hit me in the neck when we played whiffleball.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“You could’ve jumped out of the way, stupid.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Shadman’s mom walked back in and I flicked my nails against my thumb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He rolled his eyes when she wasn’t looking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to laugh but I didn’t, I kept my mouth tight.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Tell me the one thing,” he said.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I ignored him.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Shadman leaned forward and whispered, “Tell me!”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">So I leaned back and traced my initials into the wicker patterns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I said,</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“But then I get to be head architect.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">He nodded hungrily.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“So her favorite color is red.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">He jumped up and shouted.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Red!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Red!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She loves red,” he said.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Sometimes, when it’s sunny out, I like to sit at the window after school and watch Lily while she sits outside on her porch, reading.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Mom walks by and says, you still like watching for Dad?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I say yup, and she puts her hand on the back of my neck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Lily is curled around her book and I can see the way her hair falls, and how many pages she reads a minute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Some other things I like now that I’m older: soccer, ESPN magazine, knowing the exact number of steps in every stairwell of my junior high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I thought about writing a poem to Lily for English class but it didn’t work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I wrote about Shadman instead, and my mom read it and showed it to Shadman’s mom, but I made them promise they wouldn’t show Shadman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">The poem was about hanging out in Shadman’s room and the posters on his walls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It wasn’t about any time in particular, exactly, but when I read it over it reminded me of the new game we’d play in his room, now that I’d stopped telling him new things, because I said he knew pretty much everything that I did at this point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So we entertained ourselves, while playing videogames, by repeating old numbers.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Four,” he’d say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“The blue bracelet.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Six.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“The thing that you hit me for.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Seventy-seven.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Her hair looks blueish when it’s sunny out.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“I told you that one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And I thought that was fifteen?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Maybe.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Shadman jumped up and eased a piece of paper out of one of the hardcover books on the table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He took a pen from his pocket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’d begun to carry pens in his pocket.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“We should write these down,” he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I watched him carefully fold the paper at the top, and above the fold write in neat letters, List.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Underneath he put the numbers from one to thirty-seven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This was taking forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then as an afterthought he came back to the heading and wrote, underneath it, What We Know About The Girl That Lives Next Door To Johnny.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Yo, this is a bad idea,” I said.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Shadman kept writing numbers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>38, 39.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“What if she finds it?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">His 40 was loopy at the corners.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Shadman, that’d be so weird!”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">He looked at me, surprised, and said, “We have to tell her about it eventually.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I asked what he meant.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“You know, she’ll eat it up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Two guys writing things about how great she is without her knowing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’ll show her the highlights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The top ten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She’ll think it’s really cute and then I can take her to the movies by myself.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I grabbed the paper from him and ripped it into shreds, threw the shreds at him so they kaleidoscoped on his chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After Shadman’s mother came up to ask what the hell was going on we stopped shoving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I went and sat in one corner looking at the computer desk and he took up the opposite one and hit Start on the video games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For a while Shadman’s mom stood in the doorway, pushing the straight hair away from her eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">A couple of days ago we talked to Lily for the first time together, on the bus coming home from school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was cold out so we hadn’t wanted to walk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We were in the back sharing Shadman’s iPod when his eyes lit up and he nodded towards the front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">He jumped up and started swinging towards her, switching hands from one hand-hold to the next.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Halfway there he turned back to me and mouthed come on, like I was crazy to be waiting, but I rolled my eyes and leaned back.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">He stepped on an old lady’s shoe and said sorry, then squeezed past a baby carriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When he reached her, her back was towards him, so he tapped her on the shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She had earphones in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She took them out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I couldn’t hear what they were saying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At one point she put her hand on his arm, right above the wrist, and laughed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She nodded a couple of times up and down and widened her eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She shifted her weight to her right leg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She waved at Shadman when he waved at her, right before he turned around and started walking back to me.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Did you see?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I handed him back his iPod.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“Sure.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“She was everything you said she was.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Right, obviously.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“And,” he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He paused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“Well, I’ll tell you later.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">We sat there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“What,” I said.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">He lowered his voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“She said we had a date.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">He looked back towards the front where she stood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He asked, “should I bring flowers?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">The thing about Lily was that she was an away-from-school girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>None of the girls in me and Shadman’s class were like her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They were pushy, taller than we were, always pointing and laughing when we stood up to go to the bathroom or whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I always had to step over the legs of Sophia, the worst one, to get to the door, and she always wore tight jeans that were lighter at the bottom than the top, and she would refuse to move her legs even a little bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’d accidentally brush up against her and she’d make that “tuh!” sound, point her thumb at me like check this guy out, and when I said sorry she rolled her eyes or turned to giggle with her friends on either side.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Lily wasn’t like that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When she sat outside reading she always had sweatpants on that bunched up around her waist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If she saw me I imagined she would pat the chair next to her and say to come sit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She’d show me the book cover and read me the first few lines from page 77, and I’d nod as if I didn’t know them already, know that the first words were <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">That afternoon</em>, and that the page ended with <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">and later, following along, Jackson paused a minute and set down his sword beside the heavy wrought iron gates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He watched while the peasants brought the wheat and barley up to the</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I had fitful thoughts about the two of them for days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Us living in the same house together, I don’t know why, in bunkbeds, me on the bottom and the two of them on the top, his leg hanging over the edge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I took our soccer pictures off the fridge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">School was a mess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’d turn to look at him right before the bell would ring for passing and he’d always have this look on his face, smug.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“What?” he’d say, and smirk.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">At home he came over like always, to play in the backyard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’d recently gotten a ping pong table that was in the garage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We stood out there at opposite ends of the table with the radio on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I had bloody ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>First I would throw my paddle at his face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He would duck and it would hit the Styrofoam boxes of Christmas ornaments behind him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I would flip the table over on its end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’d be stuck between the old wooden ladder alongside the wall and the bikes that would fall in a heap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then I’d start throwing things at him, baseballs, bats, more paddles, the old stereo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When he was lying on the floor with the inside of his elbow over his eye I’d jump over the table, stand over him, hit him in the side of the neck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’d pick him up and throw him down so the ping pong table would start warping on one end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Have you seen Lily?” I asked him.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">He nodded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“Yeah it was fun.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“What was?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“You know.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I was throwing the things back in the garage and they were landing with loud noises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Shadman looked a little jumpy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think he was afraid of me.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">By the time everything was back in his mom came.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>As usual, she rang the bell in the front, and we could hear her and my mom talking even though the windows were closed.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Shadman!” she called.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He got up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Later man,” he said.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I stayed outside and practiced my soccer kicks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">The repetition of it was beginning to bow the red fence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was about to be dinnertime when Lily walked by.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She didn’t see me at first, and she turned around behind her to beckon towards somebody out of sight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I kicked the ball against the fence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It ricocheted against the chain link and she looked up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Johnny!” she said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I opened the gate to come out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There was a short guy standing behind her, wearing a Yankees cap and carrying Lily’s bag.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She turned to the guy.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Amir, this is my next door neighbor Johnny.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">He said hi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He leaned forward with his hand stuck out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I thought he was going to slap me five, but he wanted a handshake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Our fingers fumbled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“How was school?” she asked.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Not bad, not bad.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Ready for break?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Yeah it’ll be nice.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“I know same.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Amir grinned at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“You play soccer?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>he asked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I told him a bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Cool,” he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>His fingers reached for hers.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“How’s your friend?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>she asked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She laughed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“Shadman.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Yeah,” I said, “He’s ok.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Just left actually.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">She turned to look at Amir, who stared at her blankly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He mouthed the word <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Shadman</em>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She pointed towards our little patch of garden, with the gnarled berry tree whose trunk was weathered like an old man’s face, the flowers trampled from soccer balls, the basil growing up against the fence, the bits of trash stuck in the crumpled leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She pointed at the flowers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>His eyes widened and he started laughing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She started nudging him towards her door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He put a hand up to say goodbye.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Anyway, we better get going,” Lily said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She was laughing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She touched my shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“See you soon.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Hey nice to meet you man,” said Amir.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He kept giggling.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“Yeah same.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I think the very last thing I told Shadman about his true love was that it was her job to shovel the walk in front of her house when it snowed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This satisfied him and he reminded me of it every time we went shoveling together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Neither of us saw Lily much any more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’d two-hand force his shovel into a particularly deep snowdrift, lean on it, take off his Knicks beanie to wipe his forehead and say,</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">“I bet she’s doing this right now.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I’d <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">tuh</em> and say, “Yeah.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">We shoveled for money unless the people were old, then Mom forbade us to ask for it but we did let them know that yes, we were hungry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This year we shoveled an entire driveway for what felt like hours, and at the end the guy gave us four crisp twenties, and said get yourself something nice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But the shoveling had been so long and so hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was like shoveling an entire soccer field.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was just Shadman and me by ourselves for a long time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It wasn’t snowing any more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I made the same motions over and over again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was sweating and grunting and tossing snow left and right like an animal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Towards the very end I didn’t feel human at all, and I couldn’t think how I was related to someone like Shadman, or the guy paying us, or anybody else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I felt like a bear, transformed, all sweaty and hairy in my nylon jacket, my arms and legs too long with tiredness, sweat spots appearing on my clothes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I kept tripping over my shovel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We kept working and I got more and more uncomfortable, my back sticking to my turtleneck, my blood going like mad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Walking home we dragged our shovels behind us.</p></div>
