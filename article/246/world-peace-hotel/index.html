		<div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I thought I would have something on her, &nbsp;this nun. I thought that being out in the world,&nbsp;spending my time not with my eyes closed, wearing pants, watching television, would give me something that she didn’t have.&nbsp;But now she’s coming slowly down the hall and&nbsp;I’m smiling already, far too soon, giving myself&nbsp;away.</p><p>And now breathe out all negative thoughts in&nbsp;the aspect of thick black smoke, out into the sky,&nbsp;where they will disappear, never to return again.&nbsp;Droljang lives in the nuns’ residence, while I&nbsp;stay in the Female Dorm. She has been living&nbsp;at Kilnwick Percy Hall for a couple of years,&nbsp;come from Scotland. It has stayed in her accent.&nbsp;She has a shaven head— “I need to cut my hair&nbsp;again,” she says, rubbing her head with her palm&nbsp;— and trainers with the heels worn down from&nbsp;where she has slipped them off so many times.&nbsp;She now runs the Bed and Breakfast in the renovated outbuildings. The facilities are clean and&nbsp;well-organized. Every room is named for a tree:&nbsp;Birch, Elm, Gingko. In the laundry room, Droljang stands in the steam, folding occasionally red&nbsp;and yellow robes for the other nuns and the white&nbsp;sheets for the guests. &nbsp;“Deary me,” she says, and gently waves a fly&nbsp;from the ironing board.&nbsp;</p><p>Five minutes until dinner and the little pestle&nbsp;in its bowl will chime up and down the hall.&nbsp;The smell of rosemary and olives.&nbsp;</p><p>Kilnwick Percy Hall was built on a hill in&nbsp;the hamlet of Kilnwick Percy in approximately&nbsp;1845. Four colossal Georgian columns form the&nbsp;frontispiece. The grounds are wide with woods&nbsp;and a large lake long dried and a chapel, in the&nbsp;Norman style, dedicated to Saint Helen. A mile&nbsp;away is the little town of Pocklington, greengrocers, video rental, pharmacy, and then the hills,&nbsp;purple with mud and bracken. East Riding, the&nbsp;Wolds of Yorkshire.&nbsp;</p><p>This particular week in summer, there are four&nbsp;working visitors at Kilnwick Percy Hall: Nick,&nbsp;Mark, Bill and me. There is also a monk from&nbsp;Thailand. He has come with a translator but&nbsp;doesn’t talk much himself. He walks around; he&nbsp;picks up the pamphlets outside the meditation&nbsp;room and looks at the pictures. In the evening,&nbsp;when the residents have their puja, he listens and&nbsp;moves his lips to the foreign sounds.&nbsp;</p><p>We are Droljang’s charges.&nbsp;</p><p>“What kind of thing do you like to do?” she&nbsp;asks us. “Bit of gardening? Or cooking?”&nbsp;We work for our room, board and free spiritual&nbsp;lessons. Nick, a young student of geography, says&nbsp;he’ll do anything. He’d like to be outdoors. Mark,&nbsp;quiet and tough, has been dropped off by his girlfriend and is waiting for her to turn the car round&nbsp;on the gravel outside. Bill has been here before.&nbsp;He knows the score. The hall was used by the&nbsp;military in the Second World War, he tells us. As&nbsp;a training headquarters, then for several decades&nbsp;as a family home, and then the Buddhists moved&nbsp;in. On the first floor are the meditation room,&nbsp;a gift shop, a dining room, and offices. The upstairs is bedrooms.&nbsp;</p><p>I say I don’t mind cleaning. I fancy cleaning&nbsp;the podium where the nun teaches, and all the&nbsp;little offerings that sit on the shelves around the&nbsp;room. I want to polish the belly of the Buddha in&nbsp;the glass cabinet behind her. &nbsp;</p><p>They set me up making beds in the Bed and&nbsp;Breakfast with Droljang.&nbsp;In the laundry room, she shows me how to arrange the bedside trays. Ten sachets of milk, two&nbsp;butter biscuits to rest on top of the coffee filters,&nbsp;one of each color of fruit tea. And how to fold&nbsp;the towels so the labels don’t show. The Bed and&nbsp;Breakfast is four-star.</p><p>The New Kadampa Tradition has become a&nbsp;brand; the original World Peace Hotel has been&nbsp;franchised across the world. And the World Peace&nbsp;Cafe, where Bill sits drinking a cup of tea. Mark,&nbsp;Nick and I stand around him, drinking ours, and&nbsp;he tells us that everything has calmed down here&nbsp;since five years ago when he last visited. Back&nbsp;then, there was a scandal with one of the monks,&nbsp;who in strange moods would take his robes off&nbsp;and go wandering through the grounds, up to the&nbsp;chapel and round the lake.&nbsp;</p><p>Bill laughs hard. It was a dilemma for the other&nbsp;monks and nuns to know what to do with their&nbsp;brother. In the end, he was removed. Probably&nbsp;placed in a less popular retreat. They wrestled&nbsp;with their consciences, Bill says, because confrontation is so frowned upon.&nbsp;</p><p>But attachment is a delusion, they say. The&nbsp;teacher compares delusions to dark growing&nbsp;clouds.</p><p>And Bill says he owns a scrap yard in Tottenham. He calls himself a lay-Buddhist. Each day,&nbsp;he wakes up early and enjoys his own ritual. He&nbsp;makes a cup of tea and takes it outside to look at&nbsp;the hills, then he reads from the beginners’ guide&nbsp;to the New Tradition that he has bought himself.&nbsp;He spends all day working in the new kitchen&nbsp;they’re making in Gingko, one of the rooms in&nbsp;the Bed and Breakfast. Since he’s a visitor, they&nbsp;let him have the radio on while he works. The&nbsp;music drifts into the grounds.</p><p>I take Kelsang Lekma’s load out of the washing machine, underwear like my mother’s. I pull&nbsp;</p><p>at the red and yellow parts, the holy things, untangling, then I lay them carefully over the ironing board. I start to iron the different pieces; the&nbsp;nuns’ robes are made of three pieces, one like a&nbsp;tabard, two that drape to make two skirts. More&nbsp;carefully than I have ever ironed, I iron Lekma’s&nbsp;clothes.&nbsp;</p><p>And now breathe out all negative thoughts, in&nbsp;the aspect of thick black smoke, and watch them&nbsp;float away, out of sight, and when you breathe&nbsp;in again, you’re breathing in all the positive&nbsp;thoughts, in the aspect of bright, white light.</p><p>She is an experienced teacher. She tells us, sitting on the platform with her robes around her&nbsp;big hips:</p><p>“We all want to be happy.”</p><p>Sitting hen-wise and kind, above us in the&nbsp;meditation room, “We all want to be happy.”</p><p>I think of Bill. And me.&nbsp;</p><p>When I finish the ironing, I fold Kelsang Lekma’s clothes and leave the pile on the washing&nbsp;machine for her to find, and go to Elm to put the&nbsp;finishing touches to the room. There are guests&nbsp;arriving soon for the weekend retreat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the female and male dorms for the volunteers, the windows are twice as tall as you and&nbsp;there are white shutters from the carpet to the&nbsp;ceiling. One pigeon beds in the cold end of the&nbsp;pillar outside the window, bleating its old song&nbsp;into the stone. Others get into the hall. Kelsang&nbsp;Lekma shoos them out, only because of the cat&nbsp;she keeps upstairs. At night, I lay in my little bed,&nbsp;hearing first the men in the Male Dorm next&nbsp;door talking about something, then the pigeons,&nbsp;the gravel in the wind, the hills. It’s not yet ten&nbsp;o’clock.&nbsp;</p><p>When Lekma describes desirous attachment,&nbsp;she says it’s like chocolate. She pretends she is&nbsp;one of us. “Sometimes, you just can’t help it,”&nbsp;she says. She compares indulging in desirous attachment to eating too much of your favourite&nbsp;chocolate; it’s so good at first, and then you start&nbsp;to feel guilty.</p><p>&nbsp;I look around the room, but everyone has their&nbsp;eyes closed.</p><p>The volunteers walk around the dried-up lake,&nbsp;crunching in the grins of old mussels stuck in&nbsp;earth.&nbsp;</p><p>At breakfast, on Sunday, waiting for noon when&nbsp;I will leave for my bus, I sit in the dining room&nbsp;with Bill. The doors are open onto the grass outside where the visiting monk from Thailand is taking his tea.Bill is playing with the little tassel that marks the&nbsp;end and the beginning of his pink prayer beads.&nbsp;</p><p>“What do you do? With them?” I ask.</p><p>“It’s a mala, isn’t it? It’s like a rosary.”</p><p>He describes that counting is a relaxing thing;&nbsp;he tries to say his mantra 108 times, which is traditional. He takes the mala from round his neck&nbsp;and puts it on the table between us. He says: “You&nbsp;keep this one. I’ve got another.” When I refuse, he&nbsp;says: “It’d be wicked to refuse’m.” So I take them.&nbsp;I play with them as Bill finishes his tea, counting,&nbsp;no mantra yet, other than the sound of him drinking or the sound of the sheep.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
