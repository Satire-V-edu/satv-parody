		<div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">The first time my mother ran away from home, she was eleven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At some point early in the morning, while her parents and a few other men from the neighborhood drank in the kitchen, she went through her mother’s purse and then let herself out the front door of the apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She took thirty dollars, a pack of Pall Malls, and a tube of lipstick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She stuck to the alleys until she got to the Marcy Avenue subway station, and in the stairwell up to the platform she put on the lipstick and smoked a cigarette.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then she jumped the fence onto the platform and hid under a bench until the train came.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">They didn’t know she was gone until they sobered up and couldn’t find the cigarettes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Her father went door to door in their building, bumming cigarettes and asking about a little girl, and eventually he took a break to drink.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Her mother telephoned her two brothers, hard-working men who had always been good to their niece, and they drove up and down the avenues of Bushwick and Brownsville asking after her on street corners and in subway stations.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">Later that night one of her uncles found her smoking a cigarette on the platform of the Flushing Avenue station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She still had all thirty dollars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He drove her home, and by the time they got up to the apartment, her father was drunk and her mother had long since stopped crying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The uncle left, reluctantly, and my mother’s father scrubbed the lipstick off her face with a bottle of whisky and the sleeve of his shirt before giving her a few hard slaps across the face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He broke her nose, and it stayed crooked after that.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">The second time she ran away from home, she left a kitchen knife stuck between her father’s ribs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She ended up in Union City, New Jersey; God knows how.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She had a lot more to bargain with that time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She had the nose, for one thing: men will hedge their bets on something like that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You know she’s seen worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She made it to Union City and no one heard from her for two years.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">When she finally called her mother, she was pregnant, six months, and broke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She hadn’t had much bargaining power since she started to show.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Her mother met her at the North Bergen Park and Ride and offered her three hundred dollars to come home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My mother refused, on the grounds that her father wasn’t dead yet.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">They sat on a bench at the Park and Ride for three hours and her mother prepared her as best she could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Dilation and contractions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Water breaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Cash for a cab.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What prayers to say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If she doesn’t make it to a hospital, stop the car in a parking lot, or bring the sofa cushions into the bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Take three or four Demerol if you can find them, but nothing else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Don’t drink.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Watch the cord around its neck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Breathe.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I was born on a towel in the apartment of a hairdresser.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The hairdresser was named Amara, and she and my mother had met through a pimp and become close over a shared, uncompromising, and often violent hatred of men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That morning Amara had left for work under the condition that my mother would promise to call her immediately if and when her water broke, and she did promise, although her water had in fact broken and been cleaned up in the bathroom earlier that morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My mother went into labor shortly after Amara left, on a towel at the foot of the bed, and when the contractions got bad, she put on a tape of <em>Diff’rent Strokes</em> at full volume to hide her screams.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">When Amara came home that afternoon she found me on the floor, crying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In hysterics, she called her aunt, who drove in with her husband from Jersey City.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They brought me and my mother, who had died from hemorrhaging shortly after delivery, to Christ Hospital, where I was washed and fed.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">My grandfather, the one with the scar along his ribs, put his stock in the Bible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’d start with Mark, then Matthew, always in one sitting; then John and Luke, in another sitting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then, for three days, we’d read Acts through Revelations, in order, but he always saved Galatians for last.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He was interested in the works of the flesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After Galatians, we moved into the Old Testament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We would read Deuteronomy twice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It took us a month to read the whole thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The year I learned to talk we read it eight times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After my grandmother died we read it through ten times.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">Every morning before school kids played a game called suicide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We played with a tennis ball against a brick wall at the back of the parking lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The goal was not to fumble the ball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If it bounced off the wall and you messed up catching it, you had to sprint to the wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If someone threw the ball against the wall before you got there, you got a strike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you got three strikes before the bell rang, you had to march up to the wall and stand there with your hands against it, while everyone else got a chance to whip the ball at you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One morning a kid named Sammy got hit so hard in the back of the head that he fell forward and cracked his forehead against the wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Another time a kid tripped while he was sprinting to the wall and broke his wrist so bad it looked like a Tetris piece.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you took your punishment, you were alright.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But if you didn’t, or if you cried, or if you flinched too much, you’d catch a beating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Probably lose your money or your headphones.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">The kids who did the beating and the taking, we called them puffies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They sat on steps or car bumpers and wore big headphones and big, puffy jackets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Most of them didn’t go to school anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Some of them had weed in their jackets, or handfuls of money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One guy, Ray, would wave around a knife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But they didn’t mess with us too hard before school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When we were in class, older kids—they would have been in high school—divvied up eighths and dime-bags of weed and sometimes a few Percocets or little crack rocks among the puffies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When school let out, most of us went straight home, but every once in a while a puffy would get the attention of a kid hanging around the parking lot, or fall into stride with a guy walking out toward the bus stop, and those kids usually only had a week or two of school left in them.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">By the time I was in middle school my grandfather had started to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He was done drinking, but he didn’t breathe so well anymore, and couldn’t stay on his feet for very long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I was eleven he got disability and stopped going to work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He still read the Bible, and he watched a lot of TV, but he couldn’t use the remote very well and he usually forgot to turn it off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He didn’t go shopping anymore, and he didn’t really make any food, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He ate rice and chicken breast and a lot of cereal, and coffee ice cream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I bought plastic silverware and paper plates and bowls after most of our other stuff broke or got so crusty I couldn’t clean it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One day the fridge started leaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I opened it and everything was warm and rotten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I took five dollars from his dresser and paid a guy on our floor to help me carry it down to the street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One afternoon I found a paint can full of piss under his bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After that, I took his wallet and went to a bodega where I knew the guy, and started cashing the checks that came in the mail.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I was in seventh grade when I finally got hit up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A tall kid in a white puffy stepped out in front of me as I turned out of the gymnasium door after school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I walked straight into his jacket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He pushed me back, hard, and fronted like he was going to hit me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I squared up and tucked my chin and put my fists up, but he was already smiling at me.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in; tab-stops: .5in 1.0in 1.5in 174.75pt;">“Ey, cuz,” he said.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I knew this kid, Yujhan, in elementary school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He used to sit in front of me and mess around, draw on his desk and things like that, pass notes to girls as they walked past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One time, I remember, he turned around and winked at me, before raising his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Our teacher called on him, and when he stood up, he had one hand down his pants, and his little finger sticking out of his fly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I remember, he says, “Miss James, can you turn up the heat?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m freezing.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After that he got sent to the office and a couple of weeks later he stopped coming to class.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">He was a tall kid now, a puffy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He put his arm around my shoulders when he introduced me to some older kids, and I remember the sound of air squeezing out of the sleeve of his jacket.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">They paid me five dollars a day to shake down my classroom.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>“You ever smokin weed?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">“You ever smokin crack?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">“You ever skip school?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">“You got a brother, huh?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What he do?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">“Your parents be fightin?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">“Your daddy fuck with you?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">“You got a daddy?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">“You got some money?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">“You wanna make some money?”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">Most of us that were still in school didn’t do that stuff, but we had family problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The only thing worse than being at school was being at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Outside of either of those, you needed protection, respect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I gave a kid a dollar just to show I had my shit right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I made a profit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I still sat in class, but now I passed girls notes with fifty-cent chocolates in them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I drew on my desk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Kids knew my name.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">Kids still played suicide, too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We gave them the tennis balls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We paid attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If he was tough, if he took his punishment, if he had good hands, if he was big, we’d stop him after school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Shake him down, feel him out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Smoke with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Get him a girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That was the game: comb through the parking lot, through the classroom, for ambition, unrest, anger, and when you find it, add fuel.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">You can buy an ounce of Marcy project weed for $180.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A quarter pound runs $600.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It breaks down into $35 eighths.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>To buy an eighth, you just have to know where to stand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>To buy an ounce, though, you have to know people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you know people, in an eight-hour school day, you can make $150 selling eighths and dime-bags.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On a Friday night you can tack on another $100 hanging outside the community center, and if you have pills or E or crack you can make another $50.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Do that for a month, skipping a day or two of school a week, and you can buy in quarter pounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Start lifting weights, get a puffy, a nice walkman, a fitted hat, don’t talk much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Get high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Buy a chain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Learn the rules: names, numbers, prices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Where to stand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What to wear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Who to listen to: Nas, Big, Jay, Mobb, Pun, Meth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Get out of your apartment, leave the screaming and the drinking and the beating, the babies, the poverty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Earn something.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">They got me when I was sixteen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Behind the school with half an ounce bagged up and a wad of cash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They charged me with possession with intent to distribute.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">The guy in the holding cell across from me had a fat bandage down the side of his face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Every few minutes, he would stand up against the bars, and yell down the hall at his girl, who was in another cell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She didn’t stop screaming at him the whole time, and it was easy to put together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He beat her up pretty bad, and they both just came from the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After he hit her around, she’d called up her cousin, and he and some guys stomped the boyfriend out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At some point, she took a car key to his face—that’s what the bandage was from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I couldn’t see her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No one tried to shut them up, but a few other guys in holding cells started cracking jokes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>How he can’t run his bitch, how he got keyed up, how he got a little bitch voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After an hour or so, he started apologizing—he didn’t mean to fuck up her face, she’s his girl, she’s his baby, she’s the mother of his son.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">They brought us juice and sandwiches in wax paper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The guy with the bandage got up against the bars and told me to give him my sandwich.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I didn’t look at him, just stared at the wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He tried spitting blood into my cell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They came down and yelled at him for that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Someone told me to come to the bars so they could see me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Another guy told me not to give him the sandwich.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">They took the girl out around midnight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Her stitches had come loose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The guy with the bandage started crying, and someone called him a faggot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I got arraigned in the morning and sentenced to six months at juvey and a year of probation.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">When I got out things looked different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I didn’t enroll in high school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The only kids I knew were drug dealers, puffies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A couple of them were in juvey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yujhan was in jail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They told me he stabbed a kid in a fight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I went back to my spot in the parking lot.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">Drugs had changed, too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Weed was more expensive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The kids I used to sell to, older kids, wanted crack and meth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And the cops were out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Dealers had beepers and safes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You sold alone and didn’t trust anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I bought my first bag of junk from a skeleton of a white boy at a playground in Bushwick.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">Squid—that’s the skeleton—he fixed me up the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It happened quick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He cooked it with a Bic, it in a spoon with a band-aid around the handle, and soaked it up with a piece of cotton ball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I closed my eyes while he tied my arm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I looked again, he had the spike in me, and I could see my blood mushrooming up into the brown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A second later, he gave me half, and then finished me off.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">At first I thought I pissed myself, from the warmth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Like my blood just came out of the dryer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Everything went purple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Hot gold flooded through me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was beautiful and separate and numb with pleasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I listened to the bottom of the ocean and smelled flowers, I sank through clouds, I touched my face and laughed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My skin felt like soft glass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My hands were as heavy as dumbbells, but they floated like they were tied to balloons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Behind my eyes I watched a black canvas swirl and splotch and melt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And inch by inch, heartbeat by heartbeat, everything disappeared, until there was nothing left, sweet nothing, and the warmth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Nothing, that’s a junk lullaby.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">A couple years down the road my luck ran out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was riding on a six bag a day habit when I got jumped in Prospect Park on my way back from Squid’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Two old white guys fucked me up good, broke my nose and took everything, my junk, my jacket, my shoes, even my fucking cotton ball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After they left I puked all over the sidewalk.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I got the sickness bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For two days I stayed well on shots I begged off the skeletons I was living with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then they cut me off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I couldn’t sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My bones scraped and my skin itched like wool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I made it two days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then I attacked them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They were high, on the couch, and I beat them for as long as I could stand it, dry-heaving and crying, with a golf club we kept around for protection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I shot up their last two bags in the bathroom before I left.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I came down that night outside a Duane Reade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I had nothing, no junk, no money, no jacket, and I was getting sick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My shirt was soaked with freezing sweat. My bones were bruised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My stomach was tied up with twine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My legs and feet were crawling with ants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I puked on the sidewalk and a cashier came outside and told me to leave or she’d call the cops.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I had nowhere to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My grandfather was two years dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’d been living on the couches and floors of other junkies since he died and selling weed and pawning furniture to cover the junk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I didn’t have a phone or a driver’s license.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I left Duane Reade and walked to Prospect Park.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">It was dark and Squid wasn’t at his bench.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’d probably been back on his couch for hours, dead to the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Instead there were gangbangers standing in groups and smoking cigarettes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I stayed out of the light.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I got sick again in a trash can at the west end of the park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I walked down Prospect Park West looking for an alley, or a dumpster, or an open cardboard box; anything to sleep in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I saw an old Chinese guy rifling through a dumpster off 16<sup>th</sup>, and I started to walk toward him, but he shuffled away, dragging something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I climbed on top of the dumpster and pulled myself onto the roof of a building, some kind of restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The roof was gravel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was still sweating, and shivering, and when I tried to stand my legs cramped up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I crawled from vent to vent until I found one with hot air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On that bed of nails I curled up against the pain.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I was getting a fix about three times a week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It wasn’t enough to get high, but it was enough to stay well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the week, I’d drink enough to sleep, and recycle bottles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If the opportunity arose, I’d rob a sleeping drunk or an unlocked car.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">The new kids will break your heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They come from drunk dads or bus stations with backpacks and sleeping bags.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They get soaked by sprinklers in the park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They stay up late, trying to beat the night, drinking and bumming cigarettes, and get their backpacks taken in the morning when the rest of us are up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The girls get used up for crack and meth.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">One night a new kid, fresh out of a project hallway, took another guy’s doorway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Didn’t know any better, but the guy whose doorway he took was a junky, a sicko, a Vietnam vet who used to turn tricks with fake papers for the fags on Bergen Street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He found the kid sleeping on his cardboard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Started kicking him, spitting on him, screaming like an animal, talking about stabbing him, killing him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was still awake at the time, looking for a spot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The kid couldn’t get up, just kept getting kicked.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I took two beer bottles from my recycling bag.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I got up behind the guy and smashed the first bottle against the back of his head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He crumpled into the doorway, on top of the kid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I dragged him off and broke the second bottle over the side of his face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There was blood all over the cardboard and I told the kid to leave it unless he wanted to get sick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I got my stuff and we left the neighborhood.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">There’s things you learn out here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Where to sleep, how to eat, where to shit, where to wash up, how to stay out of trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you’re lucky, someone will teach you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Two layers of cardboard over cement can keep you warm enough to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Parks have sprinklers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Brush your teeth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Avoid drainage pipes, sewers, park benches, and alleys.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Don’t take someone else’s spot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Leave a few hours before nightfall to scout one out for yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Get to bed early.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The kid’s name was Rene.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I don’t know what you’d call it, but me and the kid stuck together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And sometimes, every once in a while, as the sun came up, early in the morning, on Linden Boulevard or at the edge of Prospect Park; after I took my shot and eased the sickness, and looked around at the black bodies and the sun-burnt faces, drinking from water bottles and taking cover from the heat; as we shuffled, dirty armies in loose formation, looking for that stretch of sidewalk or patch of grass, a little space on earth, one found pockets of comfort; in the slow heat, there passed moments of calm.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">Rene didn’t have junk before he came to the streets, but it didn’t take him long to find it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He and I stuck together, but I didn’t start him on it—I barely had enough to stay well myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He was a skinny little kid, Haitian I think, but he was tough, and smart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes we scouted together at night; with two of us, we were safer, and it opened up a lot more places to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’d be gone when I woke up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He turned tricks, I think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’d get beat up sometimes, but he made enough to pick up a daily junk habit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t know where he got his shots, but he never brought it back to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Bless his heart for that.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">One night, though, he got it bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’d turned down a guy who came around a lot, a big biker, a fag, who was positive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The kid told him he only did clean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That got him in trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Don’t know who got involved, but they worked him over pretty good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When they were done, they’d broken his arm, broken a few ribs, messed up his face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I found him up on the roof of a bakery where we sometimes slept.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t know how he got up there, with his arm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It hung loose at his side, with the elbow propped lamely against his ribs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He had his kit laid out in the gravel, and a ball of tar about the size of a marble on his spoon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Must have been more than a gram.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>More than he could handle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He didn’t say anything to me; I think his jaw was broken, but he looked down at his kit, and then his arm, and then back at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He wanted me to prep him.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">I got out my knife to cut off a piece of the tar, but Rene shook his head, so I cooked him up the whole ball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He had a clean spike, a big 1cc allergy needle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There hadn’t been a needle exchange that night, so he must have bought it from a drug store.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That stuck with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I found a vein in his good arm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He closed his eyes while I gave him the shot; first half, then the whole thing.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">After that, it got dark again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We all took it pretty bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This life has its share of indignities, and they pile up on a body over the years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But there’s things that people can’t accept.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I knew a guy who slept under an overpass who still paid for a proper haircut every month.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There’s a family I squatted with that would set a picnic table, week in and week out, with the fork on the left and the knife on the right, and say grace before eating, even though they got most of their food from a Key Food dumpster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There’s respect for that kind of thing out here, decency, consistency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes all it takes to stay sane is a toothbrush or a pair of sunglasses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The kid was no better than the rest of us, but he kept himself clean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He had papers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That made him something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He still would have gotten by, with a few more tricks a day, but it’s the deals we cut with ourselves that matter in the end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>By the grace of a clean needle, he had his lullaby.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">For some of us it’s junk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>More and more, it’s crack, or meth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We all need coffee and cigarettes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Some need a fifth a day to kill the shakes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And we’re sick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>HIV, AIDS, Hepatitis, Tuberculosis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Lice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then there’s the crazies: the schizos, the scribblers, the screamers, the moaners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’ve got scars, burns, track marks, and rat bites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We carry knives, cigarette butts, napkins, needles, and, if we’re lucky, HIV-negative papers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If not, you can buy them for forty dollars in Crown Heights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We have no burials for the dead.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">So many have fallen here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We stumble all night over the bones of the dead, feeling nothing, tending fires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We lead one another, blind before blind.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in;">This is what I have seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It peers out of stairwells, with dirty hair and dead eyes, and clings to blankets; it is cruelty with a human heart, and jealousy with a human face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am not a wise man but I understand that ours is the God of the flood and the famine, of secrecy and terror, of eyes and teeth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>His city is a forge, sealed with wool and cardboard, and from it we rise, and march, and fall, singing of weakness and of woe, and we return to the gorge no less hungry than when we emerged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On playgrounds and in project hallways, under street lamps and between holding cells, in footsteps and heartbeats and the chattering of teeth, throughout these streets, echo our songs.</p></div>
