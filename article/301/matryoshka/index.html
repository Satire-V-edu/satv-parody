		<div><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The men of the Timofeyev clan care a great deal about tradition. As far back as the Rurik dynasty, at least&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">one male descendant has mastered the craft of woodworking. The Timofeyev artisans have maintained a&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">legendary reputation in and around Voronezh, due mostly to their rigorous standards for mastery: though&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">impossible to paraphrase elegantly in English, the Cyrillic sign in the family workshop near the banks of&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">the Don reads “every Timofeyev woodworker must surpass his father in both intricacy and prolificity.”&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">These standards, once nominal1, have been enforced fanatically since Russia’s industrialization. By the&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">20th century, it had become uncommon for Timofeyevs to see daylight until they were strong enough to&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">chop their own wood. Every hour was spent practicing the craft, steadily graduating to finer and finer tools.</p> <p class="p1"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Vassily Aleksandrovich Timofeyev, a Voronezhian transplant in Brooklyn, New York, was the only living</p> <p class="p1">craftsman left from the illustrious family. Vassily didn’t do much anymore, except sit near a window,&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">carving wood with a distant grin on his face and a sturdy, ancient-looking toolbox at his feet. He was about&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">seventy-five, which made him at least a centenarian in working-class Russian years, and he had chosen to&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">spend his old age nested in a chair in the mirror-lined lobby of his apartment building. Understandably,&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">he was mostly inert, more of a display piece than anything else. In fact, nobody saw him get out of his&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">chair, even to sleep or relieve himself. But his cheeks were always flushed, and he exuded a stolid virility&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">that impressed his male neighbors and gave an assuredness to the coy winks that he shot in the direction&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">of every woman under forty who passed him.</p> <p class="p1"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The only parts of him that moved were his giant, gnarled hands and his head, which bobbed gently. The&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">mirror behind the old man’s chair offered a view of one of Vassily’s more mysterious attributes: a blurry&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">indigo tattoo, vaguely in the shape of a “T,”† which undulated with the regular motion of his head. Vassily,&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">by this point, was so habituated to his craft that he could churn out two bannisters a day without looking&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">down. A worn utility belt bisected the old man, and he was so familiar with it that he could switch out his&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">tools without taking his gaze from the window. The size of the pile of shavings at his feet was often a more&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">reliable timepiece than the grandfather clock he sat next to, and some of the building’s residents could&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">guess the time within a quarter of an hour just by glancing at the detritus on the ground.</p> <p class="p1"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Vassily was more than just a coquettish horologic curiosity. The man was fascinatingly out of place.&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">He had been renting an apartment in the same building on Prospect Park West since 1957. Dave in 4C&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">calculated that this meant the old Russian had seen a 15,600% rent increase and at least six different&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">landlords. As far as any of the other tenants knew, Vassily had whittled away nearly sixty years in his lobby-</p> <p class="p1">cum-workshop, staring through the same window that once had its flower box chained to the fence to keep&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">crack addicts from selling the plants for a few dollars. This window is now made of low-e argon glass and&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">cost about as much as half a month of Vassily’s rent in ’62, adjusted for inflation.</p> <p class="p1"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Nobody in the building understood how Vassily had managed to hang onto his apartment for so long&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">on whatever pittance his artisanal creations brought in. Even if the rumors were true and he really did live&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">on a single pot of borscht every week and go without heat during the winter for nostalgia’s sake, the recent&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">influx of well-to-do newlyweds should have relegated him to some less-gentrified corner of the city. The&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">current landlord certainly wasn’t cutting him any favors. This past winter, when Vassily’s wood shavings&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">got particularly soggy and disgusting and spread themselves across the entire vestibule, the shouting match&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">between the wrinkled Russian and the building’s bald, anxiously trendy owner was heard from at least the&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">fourth floor.</p> <p class="p1"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Vassily’s implausible presence – and his tendency to pay rent in cash – led to speculation about ties to&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">the Russian underworld. Dave read the Wikipedia article on Russian prison tattoos and swore that the&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">mark on Vassily’s neck was an exemplar of old-school jailhouse body-art. Then again, it did also look like a&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">cross, or maybe a “T for Timofeyev,” as some of the building’s more charitable and less alarmist residents&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">suggested.</p> <p class="p1"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Every few weeks, any observant passerby could see Vassily in an unusual pose: head down, scrutinizing&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">his work. The project that commanded this special attention was always some sort of small figurine, but it&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">was hard to make out what he was up to because the few people who were interested enough to look could&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">barely see anything behind his massive hands. The figurines must have been spectacularly intricate, since&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">they demanded not only Vassily’s undivided attention, but also the use of some tools that rarely came off&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">his belt – miniature paintbrushes and tiny hooks that looked like exquisite torture instruments.</p> <p class="p1"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>On one of these especially fastidious days, something out of the ordinary happened. The building’s&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">alarm system went off, and a voice on the PA informed listeners that there was a gas leak somewhere&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">in the building and a mandatory evacuation would follow. Vassily left his work inside, worried that the&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">Brooklyn humidity would warp the figurine. He waited outside with the rest of the building and stared&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">at a tree in the park across the street. A middle-aged woman jostled him and quickly apologized; Vassily&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">waved reassuringly and shuffled his feet. Half an hour later, the helmeted, beetle-like emissaries of the fire&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">department had found the offending stovetop and were scurrying back to their truck. A firefighter with an&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">armband said something terse and professional like “clear” and the residents, unsure whether they had just&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">received an instruction to return to their apartments, decided it was time to come in anyway.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Vassily was one of the first people through the door. He ambled past the pile of shavings and noticed that&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">the figurine wasn’t where he had left it. The old man’s expression didn’t change, but he was distraught. He&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">grumbled around in the lobby for fifteen minutes, hindering the re-entry process. This irked the residents,&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">but they could tell that something was bothering Vassily and decided that the best option was to wade&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">through the wood parings and leave the obstructing Russian to stew in his sangfroid.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In minutes, the residents had gone back inside. Only a small, pear-shaped woman was left, staring&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">woodenly at Vassily’s pacing feet. She hadn’t made it past the lobby during the evacuation and had stood&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">lignified while Brooklyn Ladder 148 clamored into the building. Neither the firefighters nor Vassily had&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">noticed her, because she was an eight-inch-tall figurine, stuck in a heating grate.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Tatyana was a robust figure, stout and dense, with a round face and prim, pursed lips. One of her&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">eyebrows came down calamitously – the alarm system had startled Vassily when he was painting – which&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">gave her an expression of consternated ecstasy. She wore half an apron, truncated at the torso, which left&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">the sultry grain of her lower regions fully exposed. She had one completed hand, which she held flat at&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">her side, and her legs and feet were obscured behind the cylinder of her unpainted dress. The collision&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">with the heating grate had caused an unfortunate chip in the paint on Tatyana’s head, which tonsured the&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">madonna-in-progress.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Vassily scoured the lobby. He paused in an anxious half-crouch and tilted his head to get a better look&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">at the floor, but he found nothing. Crouching with both arms extended, Vassily pivoted thousands and&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">thousands of degrees clockwise. After half an hour in geriatric pirouette, Vassily gave up and returned to&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">his chair. His eyebrows were raised and his expression made him look like he was recalling a distant,&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">unpleasant memory. Tatyana stood upended in the grate. Piles of wood shavings waxed and waned in front&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">of her eyes. She began to collect dust.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Several weeks after the gas leak and Tatyana’s fall, an intrepid rat found its way into the lobby. With one&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">eye still on the window, Vassily watched the rat traverse the room. He was bothered that a rodent had the&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">audacity to disturb his work. But Vassily’s old-world stoicism prevailed, and the rat was left to scurry around&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">the lobby. After concluding that Vassily wasn’t a threat, the brazen vermin ran over to explore the wall&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">behind the old man’s chair. It came upon Tatyana and was immediately smitten.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In the weeks following the rat’s meeting with Tatyana, shiny objects began to accumulate near the&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">heating grate behind Vassily’s chair. Tatyana soon found herself in a reflective grotto. The rat would regularly&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">return to deposit new plunder beside the inverted statuette, punctuating his visits with an affectionate nibble.&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">Over time, Tatyana’s body began to erode from the rat’s gnawing. A small pile of wood dust accumulated next&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">to the chip of paint that had adorned the diminutive woman’s head before her fall.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>At noon on a Wednesday, a black sedan slid into a parking space in front of the building. Vassily tightened&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">his grip on the small adze he was using to shape a bannister, like he did every time a black sedan&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">parked in front of his building. The driver of the car got out, flourished a black blazer with red silk lining,&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">and daintily wiped his hands with a prepackaged towelette. The towelette routine looked rather silly, because&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">the driver was nearly two meters tall and had four distinct rolls of skin where his hairy neck met his&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">glabrous head. At this border was a tattoo of a blurred, bluish “T” shape.††2</p> <p class="p1"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The supple-handed behemoth walked towards Vassily’s building, entered the lobby, and struck the old&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">man across the face with the back of his hand.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Vassily didn’t put up much of a fight. Right when his attacker came through the door, the old man had&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">brandished his tool and started to his feet, but the blow to the head landed him on the floor for good. His&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">assailant stood with one foot on the old man’s back. The assassin was puzzled to see Vassily reaching for&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">something behind his chair, stretching in the opposite direction from the adze that had slid across the&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">floor, but decided not to interfere.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Vassily had seen the glinting of the rat’s Tatyana-shrine, and thrust out his arms to grab the doll. He&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">reached her just as the attacker plunged the woodworking adze into his side.&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The old man lay on his stomach, clutching his wooden doll and staring at the window. He was&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">hemorrhaging at this point, and his fluids and entrails had started to mix with the morning’s worth of wood&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">shavings that littered the floor. A sickening slurry of bloody wood spread over the lobby.&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The beefy assassin tore off Vassily’s shirt, smirked, and appraised the weapon he had forced into the old&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">man’s side. He wiped the nearly-buried handle carefully with another moist towelette, picked up Vassily’s&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">toolbox, returned to the car, and drove away.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Vassily was found dead at 3pm by a group of boys, who were returning home from school. Vassily-slurry&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">had spread to the heating vent and engulfed the shiny shrine left to Tatyana. It simmered in the radiating&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">warmth. Everything smelled like shit. The children stood in the doorway aghast. They saw the old, foreign&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">carpenter, lying in the lobby and bleeding out. They saw his shirtless torso, which turned out to be covered&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">in tattoos. They smelled a lot of shit. Their screams set into motion a disappointingly quotidian processes&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">of cleanup and investigation. Police parked their cars obtrusively and shut down two blocks of Prospect&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">Park West. They cordoned off the lobby and stood around, arms akimbo, full of officious, desultory concern.&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">An ambulance came and carted Vassily to the morgue.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Vassily’s body lay stretched out on a steel table. The pathologist took notes. The report was a fairly routine&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">one, as far as penetrative trauma in an elderly immigrant goes, except for the section devoted to Vassily’s tattoos.&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">On Vassily’s back was a detailed rendering of St. Basil’s cathedral, prison-style, but executed in&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">stunning detail. On each of the cathedral’s distinctive domes and spires, an image of a Christian apostle&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">was superimposed and captioned with a name in another alphabet. Each apostle sported curved horns&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">and a goatee. The coroner couldn’t read the text, which he assumed to be Cyrillic, so the best description&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">he could give was “portraits of Russian goat-men.” The top of the highest spire continued up Vassily’s neck&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">and ended with a transom a few inches below his hairline.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Vassily’s murder didn’t change much in the building. Management installed a scanning mechanism to&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">regulate lobby access, a small silver box that played bossa nova music to soothe passers-by and prompted&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">residents for the tips of their right index fingers. The manager was unable to turn up any Timofeyev kin&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">and eventually just broke into Vassily’s former apartment to start straightening things out.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The place was entirely empty, except for a hot plate, a soup pot, an army cot with a bare mattress, and&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">a full-length mirror. The soup pot contained a single dirty potato, which had begun to sprout. A more&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">thorough search revealed several cans of mink oil beneath the bed. These belongings were placed in a&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">small crate – even the cot, which folded up – and donated to the YMCA. The mattress went to the dump,&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">because nobody trusted it. It was unusually heavy and lumpy, and it smelled – the old man could’ve slept&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">on there for years without any sheets.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>There was no proper memorial service for the slain Russian. There was, however, a slight swell in attendance&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">to the building council meeting the week after the murder. Residents, when prompted by the&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">landlord, wore solemn looks and shook their heads, lamenting the fate of Mr. Timofeyovsky. One of the&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">boys who found Vassily’s body told a story of how Vassily had once taught him how to whittle. This story&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">formed the basis of a college application essay the boy wrote a few months later.&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The story was a complete fabrication, but nobody cared enough to ask. A young couple soon moved into&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">the apartment that once belonged to “this really authentic old Russian man, Mr. Timinksy.”</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The beefy assassin was never identified. He was probably among the cadre of Russian and Rusyn mobsters&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">who operate out of back rooms in Eastern-Orthodox church storefronts in Brighton Beach, but there’s&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">no way to know. His motives remain even less clear. Nobody was willing to conjecture openly about&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">Vassily’s ties to organized crime, and general suspicion faded along with the memory of Vassily.</p> <p class="p1"><span> </span>Some weeks later, Vassily’s toolbox turned up on the western end of the beach near Jacob Riis Park. The&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">wood was battered, but had held up quite well overall. It must have been hastily abandoned—that area by&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">Fort Tilden is under regular surveillance, and the guards hadn’t noticed anyone jettison the box. This was&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">perplexing, given that it looked like someone had spent a great deal of time breaking through the series of&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">locks that secured the box’s contents.</p> <p class="p1"><span></span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The box got taken to the police station, where it sat in an evidence room. A few weeks later, a pair of&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">white gloves took an inventory of its contents: hundreds of exquisitely carved, pear-shaped dolls, each a&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">slightly different size. Every doll except for the very smallest had a line drawn around its equator.</p> <p class="p1"><span> </span>White gloves are for sanitation, not appraisal. The box, contents and all, went to the dump by Fountain&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">Avenue. It reposed near a strangely heavy mattress that jangled, every so often, in the breeze.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
