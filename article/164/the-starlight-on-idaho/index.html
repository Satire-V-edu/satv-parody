I try to get back to that point I was at in the fifth grade where you sent me a note with a heart on it said “Dear Mark I really like you” and I turned that note over and wrote on the back of it “Do you like me or love me?” and you made me a new note with twenty hearts on it and sent it back down the aisles and it said “I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I would count there to be about fifteen or sixteen hooks in my belly with lines heading off into the hands of people I haven’t seen since a long time back, and that’s one of them. But just to catch you up. In the last five years I’ve been arrested about eight times, shot twice, not twice on one occasion, but once on two different occasions,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>etc etc and I think I got run over once but I don’t even remember it. I’ve loved a couple thousand women but I think you’re number one on the list.

I believe you might have holed up here once or twice. Yes I believe you might have laid up drunk in room 8, this very one I’m sitting in at this desk writing this letter, which is one of the few I’ll actually be mailing because I need a few things which are in that box in your closet, anyway I hope they’re still there. I think there’s a pair of jeans and I think there’s a few pairs of socks, and in fact if you would just bring the whole box. If you did that you would increase my holdings between six and seven hundred percent. I’m down to one of everything, except for two of these socks, which are both white, but they’re not the same brand. My good old boots collapsed, but I have been given an excellent pair of secondhand running shoes here, but I am writing to tell you this—that I am not running anywhere, I am standing my ground, I intend to do the deal and here’s why. Because the last four years have positively kicked my ass. In the last four years I have been shot , jailed, declared insane, etc. . . and even though I’m just thirty-two years old I’m the only person I’ve ever met who’s actually ever been in a coma. I have repeatedly been told by medical people who probably know what they’re talking about “You are lucky to be alive” and “Nobody around here has any idea why you aren’t dead.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">Wow, I think I just took a nap. They’ve got us on Antabuse here and sometimes, blip, you just fade out and dream. In a few days that’s supposed to pass.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">They won’t let me call you but I’m pretty sure they’ll let you come to Family Group, which is on Sunday, two to four. Before I mail this I will check if it’s OK for you to come. I’d sure like it if you did. I wouldn’t mind seeing a friendly face in the circle there.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">I’m not the type to trudge along, I’m the type to come shooting off the block, get twenty yards ahead of everybody else, and go stumbling and sprawling off onto the sidelines with a collapsed lung. And pretty soon I hear the others, here they come, I hear them trudging steadily along on their Road to Happy Destiny.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">I’ve got to have somebody reminding me to stay in my lane and take it easy, that’s where my buddy Bob C comes in, he’s my sponsor in the AA, but the thing about your sponsor is you’ve got to call him. I don’t like to call him. He’s always got something wise and reasonable to say.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">So if he turned up with my box of stuff and two cents of input for the Family Group discussion, what a relief.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">Cass</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;" align="center"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">- - - </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;" align="center"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">Dear Old Dad and Dear Grandma,</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">I’m sitting here in this room at this desk at the Starlight Addiction Recovery Center writing letters to everybody I know. I’ve got about a dozen hooks in my heart, I’m following the lines back to where they go, I hope somebody up there knows I’m sincere about this, I could certainly use a little help, but I might as well announce right here that I’m not about to get on my knees, because I’ve never been that way, and if your pal Jesus is waiting around for somebody like me to do something like that before he comes down off the cross, I’d say he can quit waiting. Damn this place and everybody in it, I mean I have just about had it with rehabilitation, the thing is group therapy has just made the kinks in my mind all that tighter, it’s basically a circle of terrified bullshitters kissing this guy’s ass named Jerry, if you’re late to a session they lock you out, late to a second session you’re expelled back on the street, I mean let’s all just step one step back and take a look at the fact that I was never in the Army because I cannot stand exactly that kind of discipline. Oh yeah. I am just pissed off, and that’s about it. I have to spend two hours every single night in this room at this desk considering these hooks in my heart and writing down my life history, which we each go up at the two-week point and read to them, read to all the others, sit there in a chair, read your history of the downfall of your pitiful self to a circle of ghosts. I may or may not get around to doing it. Right now I’m just filling a notebook with jazz, waiting for my handwriting to improve itself. Like I say though -- I am I am I am sincere. I am sincere. Here’s some pretty good evidence -- this is my third time in rehab, but my first time to make it past four days. I’ve got my legs locked and I am staying on this one for the entire ride, those who think otherwise are entitled to their mistaken opinions, fuckem all, I hope they put down money against me, because if so then somebody’s walking home broke. Excuse the swearing, Grandma.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">Well Grandma that was entertaining what you pulled in Family Group last Sunday but ridiculous. Come on back sometime but keep a lid on it, Okay?</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">I’m through being the one to explain this family to each other. Grandma I know how in your eyes it’s like every one of us is the runt from a litter of geniuses, we just need extra feeding and we’ll sprout. But the total number of times it adds up to that the jail has clanged on us is pretty impressive Grandma, and those are the statistics, they speak for themselves. Whatever these people in this rehab are doing to help me I think we should pause and consider it. I’m shocked to hear myself say that, but the last four years my habits have drug me behind them over some pretty rough ground and now I’m teachable. Let’s set our ideas aside and just listen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I thought you were listening at the Family Day group session on Sunday but I’m sorry, it turned out you were more like laying in wait to pounce like a slobbering cougar on poor Jerry, who I happen to despise, but he’s the one clean and sober three years while meanwhile I’m the one drunk not a week ago. I’ve just got nothing left to say. I get around a mirror and it isn’t pretty. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">I mean to say you can’t just wipe at my snot and hand me a sno-cone. I don’t need grandmotherly help, I need trained and certified counselors to point a few things out. And I can’t have my Grandma at Family Group red-dogging the whole discussion and preaching about Jesus Christ and Satan, or anyway the last thirty minutes of a two-hour group, that’s how much time you took up jiving on Heaven and Hell, thanks a million. Luckily Jerry has a sense of humor. Thank you for representing the Cassandra family in a most stand-out way. I am not surrounded by demons here. These are trained and certified counselors.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">I am through explaining this family to each other. It’s G-damn ridiculous is what it is. I guess I can swear here as you won’t be receiving this as I won’t be sending it. Do you remember when the Starlight was a motel?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I remember when it was a motel and whores used to sit out on the bench at the bus stop across the street, really miserable gals with blotchy skin and dents in their head who’d been run out of San Francisco, you have to be pretty down on your luck to get knocked off the market in the Tenderloin. I mean you wouldn’t cross the street for them, but I guess once in a while some desperate character from one of these rooms in the Starlight would make the journey. Do you know what?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ve had one or two minutes here when I might’ve done it myself. But no more whores, the bus-stop benches are empty. As far as I know the benches aren’t even there any more. I don’t think the bus runs past here no more.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">I mean this is not a family to get their coat of arms tattooed on your chest.

I have had one Family Group but nobody came but dear old Grandma and that led to an incident. I realize you’re stuck in Dallas but if you come home for a vacation, I wouldn’t mind seeing a friendly face. And if it was my sister Marigold, I’d be smiling. Marigold, sister Marigold. My noble young petunia. It’s every Sunday, Two PM. You’ll do better than Grandma I’d lay odds. She didn’t have a word to say, not until about three-fifteen. Family Group goes for two hours -- the wives, husbands, children, any close people, they all come for group therapy. Mostly sitting with rods up their butts and every face pulled tight, nobody knows if they’re about to get ratted out, get their covers pulled. Playing it close, in other words, as far as their twisted little games they play with their loved ones. Jerry asking “What would you say to your loved one,” and they say, “I don’t know. I pass” like that. But this one guy Kevin who’s been in these places plenty, he looks at his wife when it’s their turn and just comes out with it – he looked at her -- “I love you,” he was looking straight at her and he was sniffling, crying. She looked at him and went “I - I - I -” she looked at him like he was trying to get her to jump from a high-rise fire to save herself, but she just couldn’t quite say something real. “I don’t care about these people” Kevin said<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“I don’t give a damn about anything except that I love you.” . . .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“I love you too,” she said,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“Baby I love you too!” and while we all watched, and I mean Grandma too, this couple were embracing and crying for about five minutes. I don’t know how much long-run good it does to be doing that, but I tell you this, it certainly livens up the Family Day when you see that kind of thing happening, it just keeps the whole thing fascinating. So I was going to tell you about Grandma. So Jerry there, they call him the counselor or facilitator, Jerry, at the start of the session, he comes out with a pretty harmless lecture about how the booze isn’t anybody’s fault, it might be in the genes, in the blood, inherited. Grandma’s sitting there like Sunday school with her hands in her lap for I’d say one and one half hours, never a peep until I notice she’s cutting her eyes at Jerry, I mean they’re down to burning slits, man, and right in the middle of somebody else’s stuff she just lays into him with something to the effect of “Jerry if that’s really your name I think you’d climb a tree and tell a lie before you’d stand on the ground and tell the natural truth.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Jerry’s going wuh wuh wuh and she just draws up another lungful of this good old California air which she always claims is poison and says “Do you mean to say you’re going to pin all this on me his grandmother and on my ancestors too when we are good Nantahala Mountain people who never should’ve left North Carolina and my husband wrote speeches for the Mayor of Odessa Texas and our blood’s as good as yours and you say it’s passing down alcoholic generations like the sins of the fathers?” and rolls right along with a whole bitter lecture of her own about “you’ve got to stand on your own two feet and not blame your relatives for your own miserable mistakes” with her face three inches from Jerry’s. He looked like he was ready to go out and hang himself. I enjoyed that.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">Needless to say, the subject of Jesus came up in this discussion, right about thirteen seconds into it. “The Alcoholic Anonymous is an arm of Satan, you might as well get that through your head, and shut your trap, and so on.” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">Like I say, they hold Family Group on Sundays at two pm.

Listen to me. I can’t get this across to anybody in this ridiculous pathetic excuse for a rehab but I have to tell you I think this Antabuse you gave us is backfiring with some serious side-effects. I lie on that bed over there and my mood goes black and then I can feel my mind, my actual mind, pulling itself in two. I hear the Devil laughing, and I hear him ordering me to kill people. Don’t worry, he’s been running me all my life but he can’t tell me straight out what to do, there’s no way I would ever take a direct order from anybody, that’s why I never went into the military. But if you read the papers you see every day where somebody just jumps up and chops the baby’s head off, and I have to tell you there’s been some of that in my very own family. My mother when I was four years old went psycho herself and has been in prison for twenty-eight years in Gatesville, Texas, and prison has not in any way reformed her. She should’ve gotten out by now, but she won’t behave and they just keep adding on.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">Last week here in Number 8 I had a train-jumper wino roommate with slashed-up shoes and a tattoo on his arm said Eat Fuck Kill. That was his complete statement. Never said hello, never said good-bye. Never took off his shoes. Here two days and then up and gone. He was all hate. I’ve got to get sober or I’ll get that way where every breath you breathe just stinks and it only takes one minute in a new town before you’re mad enough to leave. Hang out one solitary day and then you’re off again on a freight car waving your middle finger in the air. When the Devil gets that last hook in your heart, then he starts yanking you town to town. My grandma tells the truth about the Devil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Well, all right, when she says “the Devil’s pulling on you” it sounds like somebody’s grandma babbling, but when it’s happening to you it’s snakes crawling into every orifice, and you can’t move to stop them getting in.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">My sponsor Bob Cornfield dropped around finally with a box of my stuff, not much, a small box and the contents inside still rattled. He gets his cigaret going standing here in this room, room 8, looking around like he invented the place. These AA guys are faking about eighty percent of it, but let’s just hang on to the truth, they’re clean and sober and I’m the one woke up moaning with his head in the toilet not two weeks back.

Maybe oh well some of them aren’t so bad, I don’t know which ones though. OK I like so-and-so. First several days I was here she was like a robot in group. Carolina that’s her name. Changed her shirt and pants but never varied her stuff otherwise. This was Linda’s group, afternoon group, each time Linda says how do you feel Carolina, what’s your story Carolina, and every time she gives back the same speech, you could make it into a song, same thing over and over the first five days, not bad looking, about 40 or 45, kind of chubby but in a sexy way, made herself up just right, like a doll, every morning. Like this is the Riviera Rehab, man. And she wore these middle-age type big-enough shorts, but these white little-girl patent leather shoes. Singing her song, “My husband left me fifteen years ago for a woman from the firm he worked for, just left me flat, and every morning for the last fifteen years I wake up and think about those two and I get sick way way down inside my stomach. Every morning for fifteen years. Most mornings, to tell you the truth, I have to vomit about it.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Woman in charge, Linda, says “You mean you feel angry.” “No, I’m not angry, I’m just a little disgusted at the behavior.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Every day Linda says, “You mean you feel angry.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“But I’m not angry, Linda, and I don’t believe you’ve heard me, for you keep on asking that question.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Finally she says “Linda, I AM NOT ANGRY LINDA YOU FUCKIN CUNT-FACE BITCH WHORE” and so on, screaming to bring back Elvis while ripping out of the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Down the hall and clear across the courtyard screaming like an F-16. She’s gone, and we’re all sitting there in that room shocked deaf dumb and blind like it was lined with foam rubber, it was that silent, I’m telling you, I mean we were as shocked as if she’d just blown herself to bits before our eyes. Well, I assumed we all assumed what I assumed, that she’d never be back, she’d keep marching through the gates and out to the first bus to come along or stick her thumb out, one of those, and be gone gone gone. Like my roommate Eat Fuck Kill. But the very next morning here’s Carolina sitting in her usual chair, acting oblivious, and I have to say, her eyes were so much light, like somebody’s put two suction cups on the sockets and sucked out all the dark and sadness, she looked like a normal human, “Now to get to the truth” she said, “Hey everybody, I was a whore in Denver before I got married, at Madam Lafayette’s, for almost six years, for five years and seven months, till technology and the Mob ruined the business with credit cards and massage parlors, and then I got married, and now I’m divorced, and I don’t know what else to say. I didn’t want to face how I felt about my husband and that bitch of his. I feel a lot better now that I know I hate those two for running off and sticking me with the tab for the rent and phone and the whole middle class life. I think they live in Mexico. I hope they get a few diseases that make them miserable.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Big smile. Having fun. Ready to cut the cake.

She’s turned out so golden. Then you on the other hand. Well, it’s not like the induction of chemicals is required. A few bad days on Planet E can warp you just fine. And Mom. Whew. She sucked in enough stuff to count for the whole family’s warpage and plenty more. I was tiny but I remember . She used to sit there in her blue recliner, snorting glue or sucking Sterno through a sponge or whuffing spray-paint through a sock. And failing to understand the television. And praying to strange hallucinations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And getting results. That’s about all I remember. To me she wasn’t so much of a mother, really, John. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">M</span>ore of a sort of a story or fairy tale. Kind of a legend. Mom in Prison in Texas. Kind of a myth. Mom. Prison. Texas. Finally I went to see her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Had my birth certificate and everything, they couldn’t keep me out. Guard takes me through to a room says wait a while son, comes back in twenty minutes and he says, “Your Mom’s inside,” and yeah, That’s what brings me here today, to see the famous unremembered person face-to-face. Nothing happened. I didn’t feel a thing. I got no relief. She’s a flumpy Mexican gal in a white uniform looks like she cleans rooms. Gray hair with a couple black streaks. medicated to keep her mind off suicide. It worked too well. She was deeply content. A freight train bearing down on her wouldn’t get a response. Being around her relaxed me. Like resting in the shade by a wide, flat pond. She thought Dad was dead. What, no,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Dad’s not dead!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’s not?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No, Mom, he isn’t dead, he’s just upstairs. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">M</span>ostly crying and watching television. She says Yeah he never was much good around the house. Which wouldna been so bad, I guess, except he never went anywhere else. Just hung around making up poems and never writing them down. What’s California like?. . . Mysterious, Mom. All filled with shiny mist. And foggy sunshine. . . . God, that sounds nice, but oh well, I’ll never get there. They say that heaven’s a lot like California.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What is the problem with you boys?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Problem? -- Maybe you notice I’m a walking talking <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">P</span>iece of Shit. She leaned close and looked at my face. You could see her mind wiggling right through her eyeballs. Then she had this flash of clear light. Said Sorry doesn’t get it, I realize that. I said that’s what I come for. [I said [Lady], that right there is what I come for.]</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">Old Bro came back to Ukiah last summer sometime. Brother Luke hisself with his ass showing through the pockets of his jeans and still putting everybody else down. I wouldn’t have recognized him on the street. I’d need a flashlight and a map to find Luke’s eyes in that poor sick mean sad face. Came back to make trouble for his old girlfriend, did you ever know her?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Susie?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Bro says “poking around in her stool for my broken heart.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Lives in mud and gonna bring the whole world down to taste it. He wants the world to realize how for some this life comes hard, it’s all uphill, they just get tired, they just get so weary, they just want the cops to carry them away to that sweet land called jail and tuck them into their trundle-beds. What I wish is that he could come to a place like this and hear a couple people tell the truth. You hear the truth and you remember it was always there. It’s inspiring, Brother John.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s fantastic how men and women come out from under these lifelong lies. Roll them off their backs and say phew, whoosh, long time carrying that mother. And the things they tell. The shit they’ve done. The blood they’ve swum through. The fool moves, the lucky chances, the wins and losses, all the burnt down houses, all the children wailing in the storms, the lucky hit at the last minute, or turning their back on the hearts they broke over and over, or getting busted on their birthday, or thinking they’re dead then waking up with the sun all warm on their face, and hitching home cross-country in the rain just in time to say that one important thing before their father takes his dying breath, or getting there too late and saying it to his grave instead. This one speaker Howard had us all frozen up, we listened to him stock-still for forty-five minutes. He started out simple, comes out of high-school, tries the infantry, finds the service kind of boring without a war. Drinking on leave and weekends. Gets his discharge, goes to Santa Rosa Community College. Going for a business degree. Drinking on weekends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Itchy and discontented. One night, he has this friend who’s a cop in SR, guy says, ride along with us and get a taste. He says two hours into the ride I’m feeling like I never felt. These guys tell a citizen what to do, he better do it. They give orders and they’re obeyed and I never knew how bad I wanted that. Zip into the Santa Rosa police training program, then I’m a cop, got three girlfriends, one black, one Asian, one white, cruising in a squad car all night long, kicking ass, busting heads, top of the world, man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One year in I’ve got a sweet little wife and a six-week baby daughter. Two years in they put me on Narcotics and Vice, undercover. My job is to hang out in bars and party like Nero. Can I do that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Hell, what do they think I’ve been doing every free minute anyhow?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And will I buy drugs?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Gee, okay, I’ll give it a shot. And Howard, they say, listen, sometimes in the course of your duties you will have a line of coke laid out before you and in the course of your duties you’ll just have to put your head down there and suck it up. It’s part of the ride, okay Howard?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yeah, I say, part of the ride, and inside of six months I’m the biggest coke-head, the biggest dealer, and the crookedest cop i<span style="letter-spacing: -.1pt;">n Northern California. I did armed robberies on dealers and drugstores up and down Highway 101. I had seven girlfriends and I was pimping every one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My sweet little wife divorced me and took my daughter and I never even noticed. The force gave me a thousand a month to buy coke in little bags and turn them in, and I had thirty thousand under my bed in a shoebox next to three or four kilos of coke the force would never see. I’d wake up in the afternoon and fare forth and wreak havoc. I murdered three guys I still claim the world is better off without, but I’m not the judge though, am I?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But I sure thought I was. I took the lives of other human beings. I thought I was God. I looked in the mirror and said so -- looked in the mirror and said, You are God. When God decided to prove me wrong, it all came down like a mountain of dogshit on my head. They rolled me up and socked me with so many charges, including at one point second degree murder, that if they stacked them up and ran me through I’d be doing time a hundred years past my natural death. I’m lying in jail and that cell is sucking the drugs and the fight and the soul right out me and giving it to God and God is squeezing it in his fingers, man, every last fiber of my soul in the almighty grip of the truth. And the truth is that everything I’ve done, every thought I’ve thought, every moment I’ve lived, is shit turned to dust and dust blown away. God, I said, fuck it, I’m not even gonna pray. Squeeze my guts till you get tired, that’s all I want now, because at least it’s real, it’s true, it’s got something to do with you. So then I think I died. I think I died in jail. My life itself just left me, and who you see before you now is someone else. So I wandered like a ghost through the court system and came out with a sentence of ten years. Did seven, one day at a time. Prayed every day and every night, but only one prayer:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Squeeze till you get tired, Lord. Kill me, Lord, I don’t care, as long as it’s you who kills me. Just got out eight days ago, and rehab is part of my parole. And nothing to show for thirty-six years on this earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Except that God is closer to me than my next breath. And that’s all I’ll ever need or want. If you think I’m bullshitting, kiss my ass. My story is the amazing truth. </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black; letter-spacing: -.1pt;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black; letter-spacing: -.1pt;">And me too, me too Brother John.

Might’ve been one or two more detox trips and humiliating vacations at Dad’s in there. Shot twice by the same guy, first he just grazed me when I was stealing his money and coke, second time he looked me up and got me in the shoulder with a twenty-two derringer. Those twenty-two long-rifles HURT. I pity the folks who get the experience of the bigger calibers. Guarantee you a forty-four would take the arm right off a wiry sort of guy like me. More than once woke up with some medical professional saying, “You should be dead.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">That’s what it’s gonna say on my gravestone --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">“I Should Be Dead.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">Your Brother In Christ,</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">Cass</span></p></div>
