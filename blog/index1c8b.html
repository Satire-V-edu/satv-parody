Notes from 21 South St is delighted to present the fourth installment of highlights from the TRIAL issue. Below, read the first part of the conversation between Indiana Seresin ’15  and Liza Batkin ’15, in which they discuss Indiana’s nonfiction essay in the TRIAL issue, “Against New Feminism.” Liza Batkin: You refer in your essay to Zambreno’s disdain for “wifing,” and her assumption that, as you put it, “to wife is to lose.” I found your criticism of this assumption really compelling, and hoped that we could expand upon it. In particular I wonder what, in Zambreno’s view, defines the identity of the “wife” and the action of “wifing,” and how she understands the relationship between the wife’s socio-economic position, as the domestic laborer of the household, and her more socio-cultural role, as living in the shadow and service of her “genius” husband.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Notes from 21 South Street staff writer, Kiara Barrow ’16, talked with Advocate alum, Charlotte Lieberman ’13, to discuss her recent article in Cosmopolitan on college dating. In the story, Lieberman describes the symptoms and disease of a pervasive “whoever-cares-less-wins” paradigm, offering an analysis that includes anecdotal, statistical, and literature-based research. In this interview, Lieberman discusses her writing process, her Harvard experiences, and her own strategies for navigating diverse interests and opportunities as a young professional writer. Your article offered a different and refreshing angle that resonated with a lot of readers. I was particularly interested in the part where you disagreed with the notion that “hookup culture” is the problem with college dating, which seems to be the angle that many people take.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">In the basement of Byerly Hall in the Radcliffe Yard, Elise Adibi, a New York-based artist whose works have been exhibited throughout the United States, makes metabolic paintings that challenge the boundaries of the visual. Moving from oil paint and linseed oil, she combines natural plant oil, urine, gold, copper and graphite to generate formally engaging, conceptually stimulating work.In its Fall 2013 issue, The Harvard Advocate published one of her Aromatherapy paintings – paintings that are ephemeral, amorphous in shape and exude elegant aroma. Harry Choi ’16 had a conversation with Adibi about her work, in the studio that was once occupied by Amy Sillman — one of her former teachers — but now smells of jasmine, sandalwood and lavender.Harry Choi: I am curious if you find your works to be in conversation with contemporary dialogue on painting – the repeated declaration of the death of painting, its relevance in the face of the emergence of conceptual art, or to put it more simply, doubts on painting’s ability to “express” an idea.</p>

As part of the event, the Advocate brought together a group of writers and critics for a panel, moderated by New Yorker staff writer and Advocate trustee D.T. Max. Loosely organized around the “snark” versus “smarm” debate, the panel also touched on the role of the critic in an age of Twitter and the writings of W.H. Auden, among other timely topics. Panel participants: Casey Cep, Ruth Franklin, Adam Kirsch, Tom Scocca, A.O. Scott By Advocate Staff

            <p class="post-teaser">On February 13, Advocate alumnus and contributor Patrick Lauppe conducted an interview with American novelist Kathryn Davis. An abridged transcript of their conversation appears below. Davis is the author of seven novels, including Duplex, which was published by Graywolf Press in September. You can find “The January Tunnel,” a chapter of her upcoming novel, in the Advocate’s latest issue, TRIAL.The Advocate is publishing a chapter from your next novel. What’s the general scope of the novel, and where will this chapter occur?It’s very hard to answer those questions, because the novel is still in process. I’m not writing this novel chronologically, so I am not one hundred percent sure at what point in the book “The January Tunnel” will appear. My guess is it will not be too far from the beginning, because it introduces the sense of walking on a trail of some sort, and that’s the unifying factor, at least at this point, as I know it for the book.</p>

After making this recording, Zoë and Kevin Hong had an in-depth discussion about the piece; an abridged transcript of the interview is published here.

            <p class="post-teaser">The advent of winter always brings Wallace Stevens’s “The Snow Man” to mind. Reading it this time around, I have been fascinated by the relationship between the poem’s lines and their surrounding space. Just as Stevens directs our attention toward the silence that accompanies the snowy season, an emptiness that asserts itself in its negativity, so he asks us to listen more closely to the “stuff” before and after each line and stanza.Stanza, in Italian, means “room.” In “The Snow Man,” Stevens gives us five rooms; each room has its own white space around it, its own silence. Yet the poet does not close the door at the end of each stanza — rather, a single sentence runs through every room, a draft through an old house. There is a unique tension in this poem, one that pits pause against flow.</p>

The alphabetical kind. They lie on the surface of jagged, shrapnel-like scraps of paper and were once part of The Sound and the Fury. Perhaps the printing house of my edition disliked the book and chose an especially brittle paper for it, knowing it would disintegrate in my hands as I read it. Hundreds of pages fell out and splintered when they should have folded; it seemed like pre-programmed self-destruction happening out of sympathy for the Compson family. I no longer own a copy of The Sound and the Fury.But I’ve been carrying around its remains all semester. I sometimes find pieces lodged between leaves in my notebook, or occasionally stuck to my toes while I study.</p>

Krithika Varagur ’15 introduces the theme; visit the blog to read more on marginalia in the coming weeks.What compares to the shame of rereading? Returning a year, month, or week, to a book you rather liked the first time around, you feel a twinge of shame that the first pages’ metaphors are so freshly wonderful. You blush to realize that the comic subplot had entirely evaporated from your memory. Rereading the seminal (you thought) novel of that discontented summer, you seriously question where your atrophied memory places you within the populace; when every page seems so resolutely new, just what from this text had affected you so? Nabokov said that “one cannot read a book, one can only reread it,” but that’s cold comfort for the prospect that your remembrance of Portrait of the Artist may be as detailed as, and less accurate than, its Cliffnotes.</p>

Below, listen to Robbie Eginton reading his poem, “Fum,” which is published this edition of the magazine. I was also thrilled to talk to him after making this recording; an abridged transcript of the interview is published here. You can subscribe to The Harvard Advocate here.– Kevin Hong ’15Kevin Hong: Your poem has such a distinctive voice. The way you read it is interesting, too, because it’s hard to pin down. Can you talk about what kind of tone this is — eerie, nostalgic?Robbie Eginton: I’ve never really tried. The story is as it always is, and the giant is in some kind of space where he’s aware to some degree of Jack’s perfidy, and yet he is able to sit down with Jack. He has some kind of power. Beyond that, the giant doesn’t need to physically threaten Jack, he doesn’t need to yell … he’s just putting Jack through this communication.</p>
