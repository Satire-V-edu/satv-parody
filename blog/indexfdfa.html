            <p class="post-teaser">When a horror movie is good, critics praise it for being more than a horror movie. It’s also social commentary, a love story—anything other than just cheap thrills prodding masses to the theater. When Jennifer Kent’s The Babadook debuted in November 2014, critics called it a “Freudian study” and a “psychological thriller.”The movie’s only flaw, many said, came in the climactic scene, which Kent jams with horror tropes. The bed rocks violently and rises (The Exorcist). The boy gets sucked up a staircase by an invisible force (Insidious . . . and, like, every horror movie).But for me, horror is the genre most suited to the subject matter of the film, centered around a single mother and her young son. The afore-unmentioned father dies in a car accident driving his wife, Amelia (Essie Davis), to the hospital to give birth to their son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman).</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">“Master Cromwell, your reputation is bad,” a red-bearded King Henry VIII tells the protagonist of PBS’s new Tudor-era series, Wolf Hall. Cromwell, sullen and overdressed in a sunlit hedge garden, lowers his chin, prompting the king’s bemusement.“Your majesty can form your own opinion,” Cromwell replies. By the next episode, he’s been elected to the king’s privy counsel.The second episode of the series, based on Hilary Mantel’s best-selling novels, aired the night that another Hillary announced her bid for the 2016 presidential race. At the end of an extended montage-style video that nailed every demographic on its smiling, plucky middle-class head, Clinton gives the camera a grandmotherly smile.“Everyday Americans need a champion. And I want to be that champion,” Clinton says. “So I’m hitting the road to earn your vote.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">It’s of some interest to watch new music videos released in 2015 by the French rapper Booba if only to be sobered by their backwardness. The Rolls Royce-driving, Yankees-cap-wearing, 2000s-rap-troping Booba—a cultural annex of the US and of questionable originality—is arguably the most recognizable name in current French hip-hop. Sometimes he raps about how other rappers have fewer twitter followers than he. And he garners upwards of 2 million views on every stacks-and-sportscar-intensive video he puts out.Somewhere on the opposite end of Francophone rap’s aesthetic spectrum are what we might call hoards of young, unaffiliated, often faceless rappers whose medium of choice is the pithy freestyle. Their music videos are largely in the throwback style of Joey Bada$$—the crew riding through their neighborhood and exerting some kind of imagined dominance over their surroundings.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">A Kingdom of IsolationRead Part One here.Read Part Two here. In June of 2007, television personality and former Québécois politician Mario Dumont took his children to see Shrek the Third, the third installment of the popular ogre-centric comedy films. He left the theater outraged. The version of Shrek that he saw had been dubbed in France and then imported to Quebec, something that rendered it incomprehensible to his and apparently many other children. The dub, it seemed, had been infected with Parisian slang and garbled by an unfamiliar accent, unpleasantly distinguishing it from the international French Quebecers have come to expect in films and television. At the center of a media frenzy, Dumont called for a radical solution. He proposed a bill that would “require all movies distributed in Quebec to be dubbed in Quebec, or not shown at all.</p>

The camera focuses on bright frosting in swirls—up close, constellation-like—Cinnabons spinning on silver trays. In the background, 1940’s-style swing music plays.The whole scene runs in black-and-white, but it’s not a flashback. It’s a flash-forward, a glimpse of Saul’s fall and a reference to the Breaking Bad quip: “If I’m lucky, best case scenario, I’m managing a Cinnabon in Omaha.”The scene targeted the pulsing pleasure-center of every television addict’s brain. For some critics wary of the spin-off tendency to thrive on crass, easy references, it raised eyebrows and lowered pens. Since we already know the fate of Saul (nee Jimmy McGill)—how the Cinnabon crumbles, so to speak—the prequel could only provide “cheap hits of fanservice.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Lost and Found in TranslationRead Part One here.Read Part Three here.In this world, there are those who dub and those who sub. France, Spain, Germany, and Italy have historically been dubbing countries, replacing the audio of almost all foreign-language media, while smaller countries like those in Scandinavia have preferred subtitling in most cases. Globally, dubbing is most often used in films for small children, and as of late, in all blockbuster films. Thus, in much of East Asia, Latin America, and French-speaking Canada, moviegoers often have the choice of watching a film in its original language with subtitles or a dubbed version created for their region. Television, on the other hand, can often go either way. This situation is further complicated by the advent of standardized forms of languages like French and Spanish that are meant to render foreign films comprehensible and inoffensive to a large public.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Read Part One here.On February 28th, we brought you the first installment of a two-part conversation between features board members Indiana Seresin ’15, Faye Yan Zhang ’17, Caleb Lewis ’17, and Lily Scherlis ’18 and outgoing president, Julian Lucas ’15, centering around their nonfiction contributions to the POSSESSION issue. In part one, the group discussed Seresin’s “A Love Letter to My Stepmom” and Scherlis’ “Their Party.” In the abridged transcription below, the group discusses Zhang’s “Full Circle: (Exotic) Odysseys Through (Oriental) Rainforests on (Outlawed) Tour Buses,” Lewis’ “When the Mammy Sphinx Gawks Back at You!”.Caleb Lewis: I think out of all of our pieces it is Faye’s, “Full Circle: (Exotic) Odysseys Through (Oriental) Rainforests on (Outlawed) Tour Buses,” that deals the least explicitly with the theme of possession.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">[“coconut water”] Oscar Murillo, untitled, 2012.Much critical ink has already been spilled over the Museum of Modern Art’s tepid exhibition The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World, and I won’t rehash those commentaries here. The highlight of the show, for me, was the chance to directly see the work of a prominent young artist who had previously existed – again, for me – only in the cyber-ether, the 28-year-old Colombian-British painter Oscar Murillo. Likely no one else in America, outside a small coterie of art world dealers, gallerists, and fairgoers, has seen a Murillo painting before this, either. His solo exhibition at the David Zwirner Gallery last year took the form of a chocolate candy assembly line where 13 Colombian workers produced “Chocomelos” (Mallomars without the biscuit layer) for visitors.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Aside from the few times I’ve gotten particularly drunk and led a group of other particularly drunk party-goers in a Zumba-style improvised workout routine, I generally don’t dance in public.It’s not that I’m a bad dancer. Not to brag, but I was the male dance captain in my sixth grade community theater production of Guys and Dolls. I know a thing or two about the tango. Ten years later, though, fears of physically advertising an identity that makes me uncomfortable, whether too feminine or awkward or sexual or sweaty, keep me from busting a move whenever I am moved to do so. Before this gets too deep into a weird analysis of the sources of my social anxieties, I’ll diffuse the tension like I usually do: by laughing at myself. Duet (After Yvonne Rainer) was an exploration of the visceral embarrassment that comes with putting my lanky, dancing body on display and, importantly, the humor to be found in that embarrassment.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Garrett Allen, Glitch One. 2015The word glitch supposedly comes from the german word “glitschen”, which means “to slip”. A digital art movement has been started that explores the aesthetic of digital error or failure. I have been incredibly fascinated by this type of art and this movement and have attempted to teach myself the many different techniques. This is my exploration.These images were made using a basic hex editor. A hex editor allows one to access (and change) the rudimentary information of a digital file, in this case a JPEG image. By manipulating the binary information of that make up these files, through deletion, addition, find and replacing, and shifting, one can start to “corrupt” the original image, creating a type of glitch art.Garrett Allen, Glitch Tryptich. 2015 By Garrett Allen ’17
