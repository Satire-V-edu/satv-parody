            <p class="post-teaser">The clouds wear the last pinks of a fallen sun. I’m reclined on a gusty, deserted beach, letting prickles of numbness build up in my arms.It’s my last evening up on the top of Australia, and I’m a frightened child. Everything can kill you here. I heard talk of a plant that can lodge its stinger in you and cause constant pain for years. Crocodiles skulk like serpentine abominations in medieval paintings. A row of dense bush behind me seems keen to muffle screams.It’s gorgeous, though: a perfect cove, lightly pitched so the water strays up high and forms thin, silvery pools. Plus, it’s my last night in Cape Tribulation before returning to Cairns, and, from there, Sydney. The rugged individualist within who has pushed me this high on the continent picks me up from the sand for one final wander into a mangrove grove in the last light.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">The air conditioner was broken in my tiny room at the Smile Hotel. Even two hundred miles north of Tokyo, the late-July heat could smother you if you asked.*By day, I left my room to work for the two people I worked for. By night, I went to dinner with the two people I worked for before returning to my room. They were paying my expenses and gave me a small stipend, for which I was grateful, et cetera.One night I left dinner early and not undramatically. It’s difficult to faze me, but once I am fazed I tend to stay fuming, the offender’s existence becoming a personal affront to my own. I ran back to my room and, sweltering, stripped naked in the six-inch wide strip of floor space between desk and bed. I looked to my right, into the mirror above the desk that extended nine inches from the wall on a good day.</p>

In fact he’s already had to sell his dog, and not even to make a profit. He just couldn’t afford the dog food anymore.On the one hand, in 1975 Stallone considers himself lucky to have $106. Five years earlier, when he went broke and got thrown out of his apartment, Stallone slept in the Port Authority Bus Terminal for three weeks. Flipping through job listings on an empty stomach, he saw a casting call for a film called The Party at Kitty and Stud’s. He auditioned and got cast as Stud. After that paycheck Stallone was never homeless again, but he also never forgot that he’d been reduced to small-time porn.On the other hand, United Artists is offering him $20 thousand for his screenplay.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Published in The Harvard Advocate, Vol. LXIX, No. 3 (1900)“Wallace Stevens’ idiosyncratic vocabulary and imagery have been blamed and praised ever since his first poems appeared in print,” writes Helen Vendler in On Extended Wings. Stevens studied as a special three-year student at Harvard from 1897 to 1900. He contributed poems to the Harvard Monthly and The Harvard Advocate (in his own name as well as under the pseudonym of R. Jeffries, according to biographer George Lensing), and was elected president of the Advocate in his final year. His poetry would not be published again until 1914.Stevens’ first book of poetry, Harmonium, was published when he was forty-four; scholars tend to agree that he completed his greatest works relatively late in his career. But Stevens’ three years at 54 Garden Street in Cambridge, Mass.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">When Robert Kennedy announces at a campaign stop in Indiana that Martin Luther King, Jr. has been assassinated, the crowd lets out a collective scream. I’m viewing a film of the 1968 speech on a late October afternoon in seminar, leaning forward to watch Kennedy’s grainy image. This particular class is about Black liberation movements and canon formation, and we’ve been watching clips of civil rights rhetoric for an hour now. We’re trying to figure out how the living, swelling voices of Black leaders—people previously pushed to the cracks of American culture—can assume the aesthetic authority of a literary novel or anthologized poem. Watching the moment at the peak of the 2012 election season, it feels particularly charged.At one point in the speech, Kennedy quotes a line from Aeschylus. As I watch Kennedy grope for the words, the moment shivers through me.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">This month, we will be featuring a series of short memoir posts centered on the theme Fever. Fiction editor Patrick Lauppe ’13 describes our vision for this theme below. Fever is the only madness that most of us will ever experience. Normally, we are well-groomed and coherent; we dutifully channel our physical and mental drippings to the appropriate drainage receptacle. But in fever, we allow our duties to slide without shame. We proudly bathe in our own fluids, now emerging. We bask in our mess, our grime. We commit everything to the page, gibber whatever bubbles up at whomever is around to hear, even if it is only ourselves. The censor who usually edits our interjections for the world’s eyes and ears has called in sick. Now the truly subversive, the destructive, the half-formed, and the superfluous are all part of the discourse.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">I have cold hands, always. In the winter, I can’t touch my hands to my stomach without flinching. In the summer, friends sometimes take my hands and lay them across their face and neck like a cool cloth. My mother tells me I will be this way until menopause—something to look forward to.I collected heating pads as a child. Not out of anything as dramatic as medical necessity, but simply because warmth is charming for one who is perpetually cold. I had the whole array—the plug-in electric, the microwavable beanbag, the hot water bottle. My particular hot water bottle was red, heart-shaped, and had grooves down the front that made a pleasant rubbery sound when strummed. I would carry it around the house like a toy tucked under my arm.Once, when I wanted to skip school, I swallowed a mouthful of hot water and pressed the bottle to my forehead until I was hot to my mother’s touch.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Published in a “Special Poetry Supplement” to The Harvard Advocate, Vol. CIV, No. 3-4 (Fall 1971).Having swapped out his usual moniker “Lou” for “Louis,” Lou Reed might just have passed unrecognized in the Fall 1971 issue of The Harvard Advocate. Luckily, in his contributor’s note, he tersely reassures us that yes, “Louis Reed…formerly of the Velvet Underground, writes poetry now.”The finality of that description belies the twenty-four solo albums, forty years of performance, and reversion to “Lou” that Reed will undergo in the decades following this publication. But this issue of the Advocate seems to have caught him in a unique transitional moment between career phases, recuperating in his parents’ Long Island home, producing work that combines past and future song lyrics with free verse.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Jorge Guillén was a member of the Generation of ’27, a group of avant-garde Spanish poets who continued meeting until the Spanish Civil War. “Unos amigos” references the group’s initial encounter in Sevilla, in December 1927, to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the death of Baroque poet Luis de Góngora. The poem was published in Guillén’s collection “Y Otros Poemas” in 1973. The manuscript, in Guillén’s original handwriting, can be found in Harvard’s Houghton Library. No English translation has been published.Some FriendsDecember 1927Is that moment already a myth?
Myth collecting a firm core
Thus it does not evaporate, mythical
Its workdays clear with hope.
Hope in action, so jovial,
Without posturing, academic or theoretical,
Without youth’s arrogance bursting in,
Redemptive among the shards,
The enthusiasm visible
Diluted in light, in the atmosphere
Of fervor and of friendship.</p>
