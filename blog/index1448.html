            <p class="post-teaser">One of Billy Wilder’s earliest films, Menschen am Sonntag, or “People on Sunday,” captures the weekly respite afforded to Berliners after six days of work. Using Wilder’s screenplay, directors Curt and Robert Siodmak send viewers to the Weimar Republic’s laziest days via black-and-white silent images. Intertitles declare that the characters they are about to see—Erwin, a taxi driver; Annie, his wife and a model; Wolfgang, Erwin’s friend and wine seller; Christl the movie extra, and her best friend Brigitte, a record shop girl—are all real Berliners playing themselves. The film was shot only on successive Sundays in 1929 Berlin, so as to allow the “actors” to attend to their regular occupations during filming.One Saturday, a typically busy day by Zoo Banhof, one of the busiest metro centers in the city, Wolfgang notices an idle Christl waiting for a beau who never arrives.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">There are few things to do in Anacostia, Maryland, besides visit the home of Frederick Douglass. It’s an estate called Cedar Hill, a large, white, red-gabled colonial with the type of rocking chair-laden porch that begs you to sit down with an iced tea and a bowl of strawberries. The tour guide looks like a cross between a university librarian and a park ranger; he has sinewy but muscular arms and Frederick Douglass-era glasses, shiny round lenses that hover about his face like flat moons. He is, or at least pretends to be, thoroughly excited about the rug on which Douglass gave his grandchildren piggyback rides, and the cabinet in which his servants served pies.In the dining room, the tour guide holds up each piece of sterling silver and China kitchenware: “This was the fork Frederick Douglass ate with, this is the cup Frederick Douglass drank from, this is the knife with which he spread his butter…”The tour, like most tours of writers’ houses I have been on, has the essence of E-bay sales of Paris Hilton’s old pillowcases, paparazzi crooning “Who are you wearing?” as they finger the brocade hems of stars’ dresses on the red carpet.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">There are times when only a big box of ribs will do. Usually those times come after days already full of excess. Country fair and fried Twinkie kinds of days. Emotionally laden kinds of days—days in response to which doctors exhort patients to “not eat their feelings”. Yeah, right. People have been eating their feelings since Eve took a bite of that nice apple.So I make a quick check of Yelp—these ribs better be quality ribs—and run out to the recommended rib joint on River Street named “Coast Cafe” and make my purchase: three whole pork BBQ ribs with a side of collard greens and string beans (to be healthy). When my order comes, it comes nestled in a styrofoam box, embraced by two pieces of aluminum foil. The heat sweats through the box and the plastic happy face’d bag.When the box pops open, there it is: the meat tar glistening, fat smacking, heaven smelling rack of ribs that’s been waiting in the promised land.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Image courtesy of http://www.complex.comImagine that you have a superpower for accelerating time at whim, for making decades pass in the span of hours. Imagine now that your superpower is actually just extreme diligence, and that you are the director Richard Linklater. The product of this is Boyhood, a languorous dip into the formative years of a young boy in suburban Texas and a feat of filmmaking stamina. Its innovation was to film the same cast for a few days out of every year for twelve years, and for a time after seeing it I wondered whether its power rests solely in its gimmick. After all, The Boston Globe had gone so far as to declare that it “may be why the movies were invented.” And yet, what it has to say about boyhood, or parenthood, or generalized personhood, resides squarely in the banal.</p>

The devotees sit crosslegged in the tomb not eating the food laid before them, plates glossy pink and turmeric yellow with papaya and daal. The tile is khichri-slippery, and I have forgotten it is Ramadan. The Dargah of Sufi saint Nizaamuddin Auliya, a labrynthine complex open to the sky, shivers with a crowd: disciplined worshippers at a feast uneaten, as though laid out for ghosts. But they are vibrantly fleshy, minding babies and gesticulating as they wait for the siren signalling iftar to tumble down. I snake into a bulging queue with a combination of elbows and sweet talk, half propelled by the crowd and half propelling, until I am spat out, salty and sweating, at the tomb of Amir Khusrau.

Now there is Grindr, and before Grindr there was Yahoo, but before Yahoo—much before Yahoo—there was the bazaar.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">“Slave driver, the table is turned; Catch a fire, so you can get burned.” – Bob MarleyI am crouched on the edge of Port-au-Prince rooftop, a hooded figure with a blunderbuss and a rusty machete strapped to my back. A throng of white men in frock coats and silk stockings bustles by below, some on their way to a nearby slave auction. There, a line of shackled men stands on a platform, under posters reading “Nègres À Vendre”—“Blacks For Sale.” It’s broad daylight, and my rooftop ledge stands only a few feet off the ground. Yet the men below don’t seem frightened. It’s possible they can’t believe their eyes: Black assassins aren’t quite commonplace in colonial Saint-Domingue. Whatever the reason, their loss is our gain.A slave driver in a red bandana—our target—leads a chain gang of slaves toward the auction platform.</p>

Previously relegated to the dark, climate-controlled labyrinths below universities, federal buildings and private collections, the archive has emerged into daylight. The repositories of the everyday now interact directly with the everyday, to unusual effect.In the New York Times, Nick Bilton describes the difficulty of erasing memories that have been documented on social media. “Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other sites are happy to lure you to post every intricate moment of your relationships online.</p>

The person opens the wrapping paper and says, excitedly, “Oh, what’s this?” And you say: “It’s a collection that reimagines famous stories from the perspective of female characters.” And then, to give it a little weight, to prove its not merely a gimmick, you give a quick list of Rivka Galchen’s accomplishments: One novel, Atmospheric Disturbances (2008), excellent reviews; professorship at Columbia; one of the New Yorker’s 20 under 40 (2010). Et voila: the gift-receiver is thrilled about their new book.Galchen’s realm of exploration in American Innovations is women’s subjectivity, that vast and uncharted planet.</p>

Maps that we used to rely on before we had iPhones, old faded copies of National Geographic and Cooking Light, and a couple of packs of gum that had long lost their crisp shape, were all crammed into the pocket behind the driver’s seat. Squeezed behind these obsolete artifacts was a book, lovingly crumpled from a combination of wear, and, later, of neglect.882 ½ Answers to Your Questions About the Titanic sustained me through most car rides, long and short, throughout early elementary school. Each section in the book was short and manageable, introducing me to facts about the steerage, and the bow and the stern every time I turned the page.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">In our second installment of pieces exploring The Harvard Advocate‘s spring issue, Jacob Moscona-Skolnik ’16 and poetry editor Colton Valentine ’16 discusses Jacob’s poem, “Ruth Thalia writes to the poet,” which you can find in this recent edition of the magazine. Read the abridged transcript below.Colton Valentine: I wanted to start by asking you about the title of the poem. We have the speaker, Ruth Thalía, writing to you, the poet, but you’re the one actually writing. Is there some hidden commentary here on the poet and his subject matter or were you just channeling her voice?Jacob Moscona Skolnik: This is actually the second poem in the series that I wrote using this voice of Ruth Thalía. She was the first contestant on a new game show in Peru called “The Value of Truth.”The way the show works is you have your person in the hot seat who is asked questions that get increasingly personal.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">On April 27th, we brought you the first installment of Heroines, a conversation between Indiana Seresin ’15  and Liza Batkin ’15. Below, you’ll find the second installment. If you’re interested, here’s Indiana’s piece in the TRIAL issue, “Against New Feminism.” Liza Batkin: So, you were very skeptical that such a thing as “new feminism” exists— despite its being advertised at McNally Jackson’s, and on the back of Zambreno’s book…And I was really interested in your idea that feminism suffers from a constant imperative for regeneration, for starting over— a damsel constantly in need of saving…Indiana Seresin: Yes. There’s a lot of denial of the history of feminism, and how movements have grown organically out of that history, have mutated. Even within feminism, there can be huge omissions and revisions of history.</p>

After making this recording, Michael and Colton Valentine ’16 discussed this piece further– you can find an abridged transcript below. You can subscribe to the Harvard Advocate here.  
http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/michael-feehly-lagomorph-recording.mp3  Colton Valentine: Have you always been a fan of rabbits or was there a specific experienced that caused you to want to write this poem?Michael Thorbjørn Feehly: There’s definitely a specific experience for this poem. I spent the summer living on the Harvard Business School campus. There are lots of rabbits over there and, if you pay attention to the animals, you’ll see there are squirrels and rabbits and that they don’t occupy the same space.</p>
