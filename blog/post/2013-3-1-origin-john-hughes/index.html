    <article>
        <p><p><em>In our fifth installation of </em>Origin <em>supplements, we present an excerpt from an interview with the Australian writer John Hughes. Hughes is the author of three books: a collection of autobiographical essays entitled </em>The Idea of Home<em>, a series of “fictional essays” inhabiting his various artistic influences under the title</em> Someone Else<em>, and a novel released last year called </em>The Remnants<em>. His latest work is a group of reversed animal fables, where Australian animals are turned into humans according to the human qualities they possess. </em><em>The full interview, conducted by Alexander Wells ’13 , will be published on the blog in installments throughout the coming week. Two stories by John Hughes, “The Making of Sorrow” and “The Origin of Exile,” are featured</em><em> in the Advocate’s winter issue</em><em>.</em></p><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 497px"><a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eichorn-photo-1.jpg"><img alt="Image" class="size-full wp-image " height="317" id="i-692" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eichorn-photo-1.jpg?w=487" width="487"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Australian writer John Hughes. His latest book is titled </em>The Garden of Sorrows<em>.</em></p></div><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Australian writer John Hughes. His latest book is titled </em>The Garden of Sorrows<em>.</em></p><p><i>AJBW: The theme for this issue is </i>Origin<i>, and among the submissions we’re publishing there is predictably much talk of travel and of homeland—but we’ve also found a recurring interrogation of ideas about authorship and originality among the pieces. How would you say your story engages with these two issues, or with the theme more broadly?</i></p><p>JJH: Well, yes, <i>Origin</i> as you say is the garden, so there’s a sense of the beginnings of human life, and trying to look at—in stripped-back or simplified form—some of the key problems and dilemmas that have long plagued us in terms of human social interactions, morality, those kinds of things.</p><p>One of the other ways of thinking about <i>Origin</i> in terms of these stories is that because, as I said, I’m using a number of stories from particularly Greek myth, which certainly are there behind much of Western literature—so for me, I’m going back to a lot of these stories and putting them in a landscape and a place where it might at first seem there isn’t a very strong connection at all. And perhaps we might then say, if we’re thinking about what makes a story original or the origins of a story more generally, I think there is a certain number of stories that are available that we can tell. And everything else is a variation: what we’re continuing to do is to write variations on these.</p><p><span id="more-678"></span></p><p>So for me, one of the things that was very stimulating to my imagination and to the way the stories developed was the sense of planting something foreign on this soil and seeing what would come of it. And I suppose if there’s anything original in them it’s in that bringing together of two things that probably haven’t been brought together in this way before. It’s that sense, I suppose, of making new these ideas and stories that pre-exist us, so that the reader is aware and there’s this echo: they sort of carry the trace of their origins but hopefully they are also making something which is unfamiliar as well.</p><p><i>AJBW: </i><i> Let’s talk about influence, something I know is important to your earlier work and which has come up here again. As a quote-unquote historical college magazine, the Advocate has a long tradition of writers—and especially poets—who have felt very strongly the weight of tradition upon them. Harold Bloom talks about this as the “anxiety of influence,” with a special attention to the way young poets work to forge their own clear imaginative space. I know</i><i> you wrote poetry as an undergraduate, and I wonder if anxiety or forced creativity with respect to inheritance has been a concern of yours ever since you were young. And also whether the mixture of fiction and non-fiction you are writing now allows different modes of response to the anxiety of influence than, say, poetry would have.</i></p><p>JJH: I don’t know whether this is partially to do with growing up in Australia—and perhaps some sense of feeling outside the mainstream, or at least the mainstream of both the American literary tradition and the European one—but I think there’s a freedom that comes from the sense of anonymity. A part of you thinks no one really cares what you write anyway; there’s such a small audience here that in some ways it doesn’t really matter—and I’m not saying all Australian writers feel like that but I’m thinking about myself in this instance.</p><p>So that’s one level, but I think also because of my Ukrainian background, I’ve always felt a very strong connection from the early days to Russian or Central European literature. And there, too, I feel like an outsider, because I haven’t grown up in those places, I’m not writing in those languages, and I’m still writing from over here—that has given me a strong sense of freedom, because I feel like I can sort of claim these people as part of my heritage while at the same time being outside that heritage. So in a way, I haven’t really felt a weight of anxiety in terms of the people I might claim as being my influences: it’s more that I feel I can develop a very individual relationship to them. So I found that to be quite liberating, and I can have a lot of fun with it.</p><p>In terms of what you were saying about this working in a sort of borderland between fiction and non-fiction, it’s something I enjoy playing on, certainly in <i>Someone Else</i> and in my other works as well. If we think about borderlands geographically, as well, they’re the most interesting places in a lot of ways—obviously they can also be quite dangerous places, and they can be places where there’s a lot of desperation, a lot of tragedy and pathos as well—but at the same time these are places that have marked the boundaries between cultures, between different kinds of geography and history and whatever it might be. So I think the borderland between genres is particularly resonant as well.</p><p>And I feel that maybe this is the other thing to do with me being both over here, so growing up in this place and feeling already isolated and slightly homeless, but also feeling an attachment to a culture which is twelve thousand miles away, although I think of it as mine. I can have a sense of irreverence, or if not irreverence then a feeling that I can pick the bits I like and play around with them while ignoring the others, and I don’t feel as if I’m committing some kind of sacrilege. So I guess that feeling of not quite being at home in either place hasn’t meant that I feel like I haven’t got a heritage or a tradition—because in a lot of ways, literature is borderless, we can grow up in this place and we can read Shakespeare and Tolstoy and Melville and we can still make things of these writers—it’s more that my attachment to it much more oblique or harder to specify than I imagine it is for young American writers who are growing up in America, or young English writers who are growing up in England, or young French writers who are growing up in France.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
