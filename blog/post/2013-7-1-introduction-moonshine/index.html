Image courtesy of makeyourideasart.com</em></p><p>Here they come: three stone-faced bootleggers with their shirts tucked into their coveralls driving Chevys out of the laurel to sell moonshine in bottles in the pavilion parking lot. Here they come: the three of them now finished with their breakfast, their stomachs full of biscuits and gravy and kraut. <i>Here they come</i>, my friend says. He tells me they come here often.</p><p>We’re seven miles from the highway. It’s just past dawn. Some farm kids are out running dogs. The first bootlegger jabs the air with his index finger: <i>No-no-no, it’s the special pussy, man, way back in the back</i>. Which part of a truck bed is the back? I lift the tarpaulin further along and my friend quickly moves for a different set of jars — is he guessing? The second bootlegger heaves back with his kitchen table drawl: <i>Boss uh-huh boss</i>. I guess he’s not guessing. The third bootlegger, an Iraq vet, explains he’s been drinking hooch since his mother first tried to get rid of him in utero by chugging two quarts of it.</p><p>They ask my friend and I if we’ve ever drunk moonshine before. I lie.</p><p><span id="more-990"></span></p><p>That great grains have for a long time been illegally distilled in these parts of Virginia is manifest — literally everybody makes their own grain liquor here, including the preacher. Winos stir it in their coffee. Mothers put it in their children’s eggs so they don’t get so runny. Larger batches double as an effective cleaning agent.</p><p>The Feds hate all of it. It costs them millions. In schools here children learn that moonshine laws are holdovers from the Prohibition and, before that, Hamilton’s whisky tax. <i>Ferment away</i>, they say. But you have to pay $13.50 a gallon if you want to distill.</p><p><i>What a lark</i>, mocks the first bootlegger. It’s such an easy rule to skirt.</p><p>I once overheard a woman shopkeeper at a nearby gas station advising a passing traveler on how to make proper shine: ferment fifty percent sugar and fifty percent corn then distill until its ripe enough to gas your car twenty miles. No aging needed, but maybe add a hedge of damson berry for flavor. Or if you want something with a more florally taste you can use barley instead of corn. Rye is spicy and big.</p><p>If it’s clean as lime, your drink will carry you around all day long.</p><p>The first bootlegger says <i>c’mere </i>and pulls my friend and me aside all buddy-buddy. He’s an honest-to-god outlaw and good salesman. <i>First off</i>, he says, <i>if it’s legal moonshine, it’s probably just some Everclear knockoff for the snoops up in the North</i>.<i> </i>You’re not going to get your money’s worth. <i>You also got to avoid the rotgut crap</i>. That’s that heavily sugared brew that makes amateur stillers go blind and die — pure methanol made in old car radiators — <i>the crap</i> he says our moms probably warned us about. I want his stuff because it’s private stock. He puts his hand on my shoulder: <i>Pure corn liquor is always private stock.</i></p><p><i>Look</i>, my friend says, shaking a jar in his hands.<i> No head.</i></p><p>It’s hard not to romanticize. The two of us come to this part of the state for camping and the baby-blue swimming holes on Hyco River. That evening we sip the liquid from brown jugs and cook biscuit dough over a pine-bough campfire. Embers fly like beetles and fall onto dirt. We rub them into the ground with our shoes.</p><p><i>This is the life</i>, my friend says, <i>and the South is very old</i>.</p><p>It is very old. I readjust my seat.</p><p>Good moonshine comes at you like a bowie knife: point first, dulling your senses the deeper and deeper it goes. It’s like walking backwards. You step back away from something, say, a river. Your vision gets lost in the river — the carp and the mud. Then the river gets lost in the hills, the hills in the mountains, and the mountains in the sky. The sky grows wider, the mountains flatter. Somewhere in the center is still the river, of course, but you can’t be bothered to recall where.</p><p>For a minute you might even forget your toes.</p><p>We’ve all been drunk, but 160-proof grain liquor is a different kind of play. It only takes a few ounces for even the meanest backwoods drinkers, men who knock back a pint or more a day for forty years, to feel it whop down in their skulls, as if something scooped out the brain matter and poured in napalm. Some say it’s downright evil. <i>Twenty bucks a gallon</i>, the second one had told us. Our cotton shirts are soaked from the summer heat. Or is it because of the fire? The radio mutters words in a language we don’t understand. The dough is done. Someone blows on a harp.</p><p>My father never drank moonshine, nor his father or grandfather, which means I’m the first man in my family in at least three generations to touch the stuff. Shakespeare probably never drank moonshine either — whisky perhaps. Still, the guy gets credit for popularizing the name — <i>moonshine.</i></p><p>In Act V of <i>The Tempest</i>, Prospero soliloquizes one last time: <i>You demi-puppets that by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make</i> (V.i.38-39). He describes the great feats of magic he has performed in his life but that he will do no more, including harking the planets from the sky and planting toadstools by moonlight. I like to think of moonshiners as the old Prospero’s acolytes — disenfranchised magicians spurned for their nighttime tricks, grump devils cast down. Incidentally, the soliloquy marks the end of Shakespeare’s solo writing career.</p><p>We’re used to hearing the drunkard’s story — the drunkard who grabs onto your arm and pants, <i>I did this and it was so interesting</i>. This next series of posts will come from such inebriates among us — the moon-dogs, the poisoners, the magicians, the smugglers, the lunatics.</p><p>However, it’s better to think of our stories as fiction, for one can never be too wary of the law. Indeed, I never met three bootleggers outside a camping pavilion in the Virginia piedmont. They never sold me six full jars with the affront “XXX” written on them in Sharpie, the old joke.</p><p>Furthermore, I never overheard a woman shopkeeper — the one from the gas station. And as the traveler handed her cash for a 20oz. Pepsi and chips, she never mentioned that years ago the mayor of her county seat, drunk on moonshine, shit on his kitchen table and burned his house to the ground.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
