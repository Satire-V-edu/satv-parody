        <p><p class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1542" style="width: 463px"><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/orson-war-of-the-worlds2.jpg"><img alt="image courtesy of berfrois.com" class="size-full wp-image-1542" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/orson-war-of-the-worlds2.jpg?w=670"></a></p><p class="wp-caption-text">image courtesy of berfrois.com</p><p class="wp-caption-text">image courtesy of berfrois.com</p><p>It might be said that a party reaches its critical mass when the rate of increase of the volume of guests surpasses the rate of decrease of the volume of refreshments. On one snowless December night, the moment arrived, fairytale-like, just before midnight. The last spoonful of salsa scooped, my coat buttoned, the hostess thanked, my exit was only halted by the call of one or two (gender-neutral) princes—“We have to discuss <em>Serial</em>!”<span id="more-1536"></span></p><p>There was nothing to do but stay and form a small circle of devotees, where every half-hearted change of subject could be punctured by a brief, “But what about the Nisha call?” Midnight passed without notice as we looked to a date five days hence.</p><p>“If she ends it with another meditation on epistemology, I swear,” one partygoer scoffed, implying that if Sarah Koenig did not reveal precisely <em>whodunit</em>, she’d meet a fate worse than Leakin Park.</p><p>My friend was not alone in his demand for a satisfying series finale. <em>Slate </em>podcaster Mike Pesca (podcasting about a podcast) echoed his statement with a stern warning to Koenig: “Don’t let this be a contemplation on the nature of truth.” The humor site funnyordie.com released a viral parody where a desperate Koenig gives in to her audience’s need for answers by confessing that she committed the murder herself.</p><p>“I do podcasts,” the parody-Koenig pleads on air, “It was supposed to be for four people. Do you think if I thought this was going to be anything I would have had MailChimp sponsor it?”</p><p>And, of course, <em>Serial </em>was something — the most popular podcast ever, reaching five million downloads on iTunes, inspiring an <em>SNL </em>parody, and infiltrating small talk everywhere. It was the podcast that launched a thousand subreddits.</p><p>What made <em>Serial</em> so popular? To answer this question, we might take a cue from Koenig and consider a timeline. It spans a little over a month, November 20<sup>th</sup> to December 11<sup>th</sup>, twenty-two days and three serial episodes. Between the airing of those episodes, two police officers avoided indictment for the killing of two unarmed black men, <em>Rolling Stone </em>apologized for inaccuracy in its story about a brutal gang-rape, and the Senate released a report revealing C.I.A. torture tactics in the wake of 9/11.</p><p>Five million listeners longing to have faith in Sarah Koenig; a nation losing faith in its police force, its justice system, its media, its government.</p><p>In the first episode of <em>Serial</em>, Koenig wryly notes that her true-crime tale has an air of epic tragedy. “On paper, the case was like a Shakespearean mash-up,” she narrates, “young lovers from different worlds thwarting their families, secret assignations, jealousy, suspicion, and honor besmirched.” The show’s medium, serialized broadcasts, inspires nostalgia for a slightly more recent time—the era of radio, the fireside chat, the authority of a deep distant voice. And, with that authority, faith in truth and justice.</p><p>But for all their nostalgia, for all the faith they longed to have in Koenig’s distant voice, today’s media-weary <em>Serial </em>fans could not resist taking matters into their own keyboard-cramped hands. The hard-boiled detective posts on Reddit from his basement “office;” his femme fatale calls herself Sprinkles1. The <em>Serial </em>forums on the site range from obscure, dug-up facts (“Jay’s lawyer specialized in animal law” says seriallysurreal) to conspiracy theories (“A drug dealer did it,” Sprinkles insists) to confirmations and refutations of Koenig’s least significant statements (“The Crab Crib: shrimp sale confirmed,” daveaflav assures us).</p><p>Squeebeaux has posted a comprehensive list of maps, videos and images, ranging from a hand-drawn timeline of Jay’s testimony to a satellite map of the all-important Best Buy to a video of the fallen tree that covered Hae’s body in Leakin Park. In <em>Serial’s </em>consumption, nostalgia for the authority of the radio age competes with the realities of the Internet age, where every user can assume his own authority.</p><p>Of course, amateur authority is often misleading, and some times just plain libelous. One post, titled “Could Jay’s Father be Involved?,” claims to have discovered Jay’s criminal record. As the post’s author acknowledges, Mr. Wilds never appears on the show—save for a brief mention of  “an older man” who answered Jay’s phone.</p><p>The fan approach to <em>Serial </em>is indicative of a larger Internet-enabled approach to news. AMAthon comments on a pre-finale <em>Serial </em>thread, “We’re only two days away from Find the Boston Bombers, part two.” In spring 2013, a massive community of Reddit users identified and accused a Muslim man named Sunil Tripathi of launching the Boston Marathan attack; when police arrested the real terrorists, they issued an apology. Another Internet suspect, a 17-year-old boy Redditors called “Blue Robe Man,” attracted attention because a video showed his shoulder-bag sagging The search for the bombers saw a renewed faith in law enforcement, but this faith was not enough to deter citizens from trying to enforce the law themselves.</p><p>Forget Hae’s murderer. It is 2015, and we are all on trial.</p><p>In the pre-Reddit age, one entertainment broadcast made almost as many headlines as <em>Serial. War of the Worlds, </em>the Orson Welles broadcast of a sci-fi story of an Earth besieged by Martians, aired in the format of a news story on October 30, 1938. The front page story of the <em>Times </em>the next day read, “Radio Listeners in Panic, Taking War Drama as Fact.” It describes the “wave of mass hysteria” that ensued, traffic jams and clogged telephone lines. In Newark, the newspaper reports, doctors administered shock treatment to fifteen listeners hospitalized. While some listeners called the <em>Times </em>for information, others didn’t wait for the fact-check. In New York, a throng of playgoers rushed out of their seats when a man’s radio-listening wife called the house. The manager had quite literally shouted “Fire!” in a crowded theater.</p><p>Desperately trying to persuade listeners not to flee the city, local police officers sent out radio broadcasts and the <em>AP </em>assured the public that the alien attack was mere  “studio dramatization.”  With the technology of the times, these statements only reached a few, and they could hardly challenge the authority of Welles’s own news-bulletin. Indeed, Welles copied the “first-hand report” radio style pioneered by Herbert Morrison in his coverage of the Hindenburg disaster.</p><p>Recently, though, historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow have argued that the broadcast did not, in fact, cause wide-scale panic; rather, they claim, print newspapers amplified the broadcast’s effect to “wage war on radio.” While pre-broadcast surveys showed only 5,000 tuned to Welles’s channel, as the story of “mass hysteria” spread, thousands more claimed to have been victims of that hysteria themselves.</p><p>Other historians stand by the original story. The investigation, in any case, did not come until 2013. Whether Americans in 1938 were incited to panic by a broadcast or incited to fake panic by reports of a broadcast, no one did any fact-checking, then.</p><p>However, radio was not always categorized by singular authority.. There were no laws or regulations restricting amateur radio broadcasters—the Reddit users of yore—until 1912. At one point, 3,000 hams belonged to the free “Wireless Association of America.” Though Congress eventually limited most users to a wavelength of 200 meters, it did not ban their stations. Selected amateurs could receive special licenses for better wavelengths. Some of them went, so to speak, viral.</p><p>When America entered World War I, amateurs feared that they’d be shut down, for the 1912 Radio Act gave the President permission to close stations during wartime. Although the Navy banned amateur transmissions in the West for a few months during the war, some newspaper commentators believed that hams could help the war effort. A 1916 San Francisco <em>Chronicle </em>Op-Ed titled “20,000 American Watchdogs” promised that “the wireless man” was essential to quick communication when closed telegraph and telephone lines isolated sections of the country. The author insists, “if France or Belgium had possessed an affective amateur wireless scout service, there might possibly be a different story to tell today.”  Like the well-intentioned but ultimately misguided Boston Bombing sleuthers, Americans thought multiple eyes—and voices—could provide the key to truth.</p><p>Not until the development of public address systems, long-distance telephone lines, and vacuum-tube radio transmitters did national radio coverage become possible. The American Telegraph Company proposed a system that would use telephone wires to link radio systems together. By the 1930’s, three networks dominated U.S. broadcasting: the Red and Blue divisions of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting System. It was CBS that inspired that “mass hysteria” with its broadcast of <em>War of the Worlds.</em></p><p>In the 1950’s and 60’s, with the growing popularity of television, the commercial radio industry began to decline. In its wake, President Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act to encourage “the growth and development of non-commercial radio;” NPR, which produces <em>Serial, </em>attributes its creation to this law.</p><p>Today, besides satellite-delivered radio, NPR produces a number of podcasts. Radio-style shows can be created by anyone with a PC. In his 2005 essay “Will the Podcast Kill the Radio Star?” Richard Berry notes that with the advent of the podcast, “audiences are producers… audiences, cut off from traditional media, rediscover their voices.” Unlike radio amateurs at the turn of the century, podcasters can reach subscribers around the world.</p><p>Today’s deep distant voice can belong to anyone. It inspires other voices, in Twitter comments and Reddit forums. While constant fact checking prevents the average Internet-user from fooling the world into believing it’s under alien attack, <em>Serial </em>has shown us that amateur authority can inspire a “mass hysteria” of a different sort.</p><p>The paradox of <em>Serial </em>rises out of historically shifting attitudes toward media authority. Since its conception, audio broadcasting has swung on a pendulum between democratization and centralization, monopoly and the rule of the masses. The American audience has longed, at turns, for both; it has had faith in the distant voice and it has voiced its own truth. In our plea for Sarah Koenig to provide a satisfying conclusion to <em>Serial, </em>we express our deep-rooted need to trust an authority with the answers. In our subreddits and speculation, we express the need, equally great, to find our own truth.</p></p>
