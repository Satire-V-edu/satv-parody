Brut</a> is an art and literary magazine run by Advocate alumni, including former design board member Kayla E. and president emeritus Tyler Richard. The launch event for their first print issue will take place Saturday, March 28 at 6pm at the Carpenter Center and will include a film screening as well as a panel on gender disparities in the arts. The following is a conversation with Kayla and Tyler.<span id="more-1683"></span></p><p><strong>ADVO:</strong> <strong>Tell me about yourselves</strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> Hi, I’m Kayla. Aside from being editor-in-chief of <i>Nat. Brut</i> since January of 2014, I’m also a freelance designer and cartoonist. I’m working on two books and several different comic strips concurrently. When I’m not doing all that stuff, I spend my time being a reclusive vegan and watching<i> Law and Order SVU</i> and lots of disturbing docs.</p><p><strong><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/devils.jpg"><br>

My eyes are a vague blue, my sign is Cancer, and I have worked as one of </span><i>Nat. Brut’</i><span style="line-height:1.5;">s associate editors since April 2014. The majority of my duties are concentrated in the legal and financial ends of the magazine. I also serve on several of </span><i>Nat. Brut</i><span style="line-height:1.5;">’s creative “task forces” that devise and execute the diverse side-projects that supplement our biannually printed issues. During my time off the ol’ Nat. Brut clock, I write poems and am a graduate student in South Asian studies at Harvard University.</span></p><p><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/tyler.jpg"><img alt="Tyler" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1688" height="509" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/tyler.jpg?w=670&amp;h=509" width="670"></a></p><p style="text-align:center;"><em>Tyler plugging away on a project.</em></p><p><strong>ADVO: For the uninitiated among us, what is Nat. Brut?</strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> <i>Nat. Brut</i> is a biannual art and literary magazine. We just moved into print, but we offer most of our content online, as well as a bunch of online-only multimedia content. We publish all sorts of stuff – art, short fiction, humor, poetry, comics, animation, short films. We also love found photos, and we’re obsessed with the public domain.</p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>Oh! And we also oversee a handful of side projects. For instance, <a href="http://www.natbruttv.com/">NBTV</a>, our television serial, utilizes archival video to experiment with the imaginative potentials of channel surfing. <a href="http://www.natbrut.com/n-a-t--b-o-o-k-s.html">Nat. Books</a>, our online publishing house, releases obscure or out-of-print works in high-quality pdfs.</p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> Also, Sarah Hopkinson, our blog editor, is producing original content on our <a href="http://natbrut.tumblr.com/">tumblr </a>multiple times a week. The blog is a gold mine and Sarah is a godsend to us. The blog is a daily dose of fun that is integral to who and what <i>Nat. Brut </i>is these days. It’s a site for our more outspoken and progressive detangling of ideas.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: Why the name?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>It should come as no surprise that this question is the one we’re most frequently asked. Heck, it was the first question I asked Kayla when she first approached me about joining staff. As I like to see it, there are two different—though not totally unrelated—explanations for <i>Nat. Brut</i>’s name, one that is factual and largely banal and one that was retroactively fabricated and much more slick.</p><p>In the first origin story, <i>Nat. Brut</i>’s founders, when first toying with the idea of starting an online zine in 2012, suddenly happened upon a wondrous strange turn of phrase. Nat. Brut. They didn’t quote know what the words meant, but they knew they sounded cool. I agree that ‘Nat. Brut’ does sound cool. What’s more, the founders noticed that ‘Nat. Brut’ carries within it echoes of the phrase ‘art brut,’ a term first coined by the artist Jean Dubuffet to categorize a range of art works and art forms lying outside of the art world’s conventional purview. This resonance has become increasingly more appropriate as <i>Nat. Brut </i>has become ever more committed to publishing the work of demographics traditionally underrepresented by literary and art publications, although we ourselves would never call such work brut.</p><p>The second explanation is that ‘Nat. Brut’ is a piece of purposeful nonsense. It is an empty signifier just waiting to be imbued with meaning, a meaning that we create through what we associate with the magazine. That is, the total accumulation of artists, authors, pieces, films, comics, episodes, interventions, gags, swags, events, non-events, pressing issues, supplemental issues, and legal boilerplate. This explanation, for me, always calls to mind found objects, which only take on the status of ‘art object’ when placed in a particular context with a particular intention. One might say that <i>Nat. Brut’s </i>name is similarly a piece of found language, of <i>langue trouvée</i>, whose sense entails only in relation to the artistic, social, and environmental context that the magazine’s editors, contributors, and readers construct around it.</p><p>Yes, is that a hand I see in the back?</p><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/students.jpg"><img alt="Students" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1687" height="441" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/students.jpg?w=670&amp;h=441" width="670"></a> <em>Students learning</em> Nat. Brut.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: How is Nat. Brut different from other arts and literary publications?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>As soon as one opens up <i>Issue Five</i> and glances at the table of contents, one will notice the profusion of media that <i>Nat. Brut </i>publishes, a spectrum much wider than most other literary publications. We publish everything under the sun as well as some things above it. We believe that the juxtaposition of media and registers generates unique and often challenging insights. For example, placing a piece of flash fiction alongside a slapstick comic creates an emotional counterpoint that causes a reader to reevaluate both pieces in terms of each other. In a way, this surfeit of art forms and registers mimics the process by which most of us consume media, viz. through web browsing and news feeds. Of course, there are those who hold that such juxtaposition is distracting and violates a piece’s “artist integrity,” and this claim is not without its merits. If one feels that way, then they can either stick to reading our content online or go elsewhere, I guess.</p><p>As Kayla has mentioned, a not insignificant portion of what we publish comes from the public domain. This decision stems from an understanding that artistic underrepresentation is not a problem limited to the present. Aesthetic, racial, gender, sexual, geographic, and class biases in publishing have always existed, and because curation is at its essence a process of selective omission, they always will. Our Photobox and A/V Corner series are our humble attempts to right (and write) a few of the wrongs of the publishing past. That, and share with our readers what gems can be unearthed through the venerable act of obsessive web surfing.</p><p>Oh, it’s also worth noting that <i>Nat. Brut </i>has a distinctly silly side. Not silly in the sense of lacking judgment, but rather in the sense of being open to taking risks and making mistakes; of following whimsical intuitions to their logical or nonsensical ends; of laughing at ourselves from time to time. Many literary publications operate according to self-imposed senses of propriety that, when left unchecked, lead to ossified, stuffy, and admittedly, boring cultural institutions.</p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>Also, when I became editor, I didn’t just want<i> Nat. Brut </i>to be an art and literary magazine that operates outside of or above conversations about race, gender, and class. I want <i>Nat. Brut </i>to be a part of these conversations by working with artists and writers who are actively engaged in them. I feel like many magazines hold themselves accountable for upholding ideals that are solely artistic or literary. Often the goal is to present the best, or the newest, or the edgiest, or the most surprising, or the most under-appreciated, or the most intellectually rigorous work, and individual issues may tackle specific “themes” like feminism or poverty. None of these approaches are necessarily bad or wrong, but when a magazine is focused primarily on holding itself to an artistic responsibility, it’s easy to allow social responsibilities to fall by the wayside, and to become part of the problem. Frankly, I’m tired of seeing white men running magazines and publishing the same tired old straight, white, cis-het male demographic. I’m frustrated with the landscape, and my goal with <i>Nat. Brut</i> is to try to manifest the change I want to see in that landscape.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: How “Harvard” is Nat. Brut, if at all? How did Harvard influence Nat. Brut, if the influence is there?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>When not secretly imagining <i>Nat. Brut </i>as an unconventional tech start-up, I like to imagine it as a growing, preternaturally articulate child. And children, as we all know, come from somewhere and carry that somewhere within them no matter the places they go or the things they do. Put less tritely, genes don’t lie. And were one to map <i>Nat. Brut’s</i> genome, one would find that many of its genes are crimson. As one can discover through hardly any mouse clicks, much of the magazine’s current staff are either Harvard students and Harvard alumni. This is due to the fact that when Kayla and Axel first took charge of the publication, they understandably reached out to people whom they knew about joining the magazine, and most of these people were their college friends. Although <i>Nat. Brut</i> might be run by Harvard grads, that does not mean that <i>Nat. Brut </i>is a “Harvard” publication. To be honest, interpreting the idea of ‘Harvard’ in certain negative, historically-conditioned lights, we strive to be the opposite of a “Harvard” publication.</p><p>That said, it’s worth acknowledging that Harvard has contributed the bedrock of our staff’s professional expertise, and for this training, we are very grateful. During their undergraduate tenure, many of our staff members were heavily involved in <i>The Harvard Lampoon</i> and<i> The Harvard Advocate</i>, where they acquired experience composing, designing, editing, and underwriting established, large-scale publications with readerships in the tens of thousands. When we’re feeling especially precocious, we like to place <i>Nat. Brut</i> in the long tradition of print publications with strong ties to Harvard, including <i>The National Lampoon</i> and <i>N+1</i>. When we’re not, it’s usually because we’re looking at our bank account.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: So you’re in Dallas. Is </strong><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ddelheas/30-ways-you-know-you-live-in-dallas-6aws"><strong>this article</strong></a><strong> accurate?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>Haha, yes and no, I guess. Who writes these things, anyway? If you’re a red-blooded, sports-loving, beer-drinking, square-dancing, truck-driving, meat-eating, Texas-proud, straight white guy with an active nightlife who’s lived in Dallas for thirty years or so, you’ll probably take no issue with this list. Otherwise, it’s pretty annoyingly presumptuous. Not to say that I take any offense at all at Dallas being summed up in trite, gross ways. I’m not particularly attached to this city.</p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>But if you’re willing to drive thirty minutes outside of Dallas, Denton can be a pretty fun place, especially Mabel’s Beauty Shop & Chainsaw Repair out on University Drive. That place rocks!</p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> Best place in all of DFW!</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: What’s the good and the bad of Dallas?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>The good is that I can afford to live here and pursue freelance work. I can’t afford to live in any of the few cities I would want to move to and still do what I want to be doing creatively or professionally. The part of Dallas where I’m based now is relatively quiet, and there’s no overt community or culture, so there’s little here to distract me. This may seem lonely, but it allows me to remain focused and productive. Basically, it’s cheap and I’m not miserable. It’s also a great place to nurture <i>Nat. Brut</i>. I don’t want the magazine to have a regional identity, and I think that if I lived in a city I actually liked, then there would be a risk of wanting to connect the magazine to the community and place it within a local scene. <i>Nat. Brut</i> is ever-evolving, and I want it to belong to everyone, everywhere.</p><p>As far as the bad goes, there’s plenty to hate about Dallas, and Texas in general is a hotbed for repulsive patriarchal politics and social injustice in the way of gay rights, abortion, and racial violence. A lot of people question my choice to live in Texas. Some people seem disappointed by it and assume that I’m not able to live up to my (or <i>Nat. Brut</i>’s) full potential here, which is a bit insulting. There are certainly a lot of really unappealing things about Texas, but it’s important for me to stay grounded by remaining in the trenches, so to speak. By living in a place that is ripe with the sorts of social and political problems that I feel very strongly about, I’m able to remain intimately in touch with these issues and to figure out ways to respond productively to them. This tension also feeds into my creative practices, and fuels my work as both an artist and an editor.</p><p><strong>ADVO:</strong> <strong>Tell me about your latest issue. What are some challenges of migrating from online to print?</strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>Money. Just kidding not just kidding. During its first two years, <i>Nat. Brut</i> was blessed to live in sweet, halcyon days when the only operating cost was that of maintaining a domain name. Last fall, however, Kayla, Axel, and I collectively decided that we were interested in taking <i>Nat. Brut’</i>s free-spirited, socially-mindful aesthetic commitments and seeing how it would manifest itself in a physical object.</p><p>Approached from a theoretical perspective, a printed object is at its core ontologically different from a digital object. The former takes up physical space, has weight, is a different type of furniture. That is to say, it curates movement differently, the turn of a page directional in a way that a mouse click is not. All of these new discrepancies and variables were of extreme interest to us.</p><p>Approached from the seat of praxis, a printed object is radically more expensive to produce and requires an entirely different intra-organizational structure to underwrite it. Some magazines elect to create a business board responsible for selling advertisements. Others opt to hire a grant writer or two and go the non-profit route. Still a few more choose to hedge their bets and go for both. We lie in this third category.</p><p>Transitioning into print has also forced us to double down on our commitment to environmental sustainability. No one can deny that today’s world is a world of excess. Landfills brim with discarded printed material, and worldwide deforestation continues to catalyze climate change and lead us one step further into the planet’s sixth mass extinction. With these harrowing images in mind, we had to think long and hard about the ethics of creating an art object that would be irremediably tied to these processes of environmental decay. In the end, <i>Nat. Brut</i> decided that all of its issues would be printed on 100% post-consumer recycled paper. While some literary magazine choose to outsource their printing and materials in order to drastically reduce production costs, we have decided to eat the premium cost in order to ensure that we and our readers, while reading our issues in bed, can sleep at night.</p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>As for our latest issue, aside from it being our first in print, a large part of my vision was to accomplish a substantially visible gender parity and have a significant number of our contributors be people of color. I think it’s nonsense when other literary and art magazines aren’t diverse. There’s no excuse.</p><p><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ssue-five-flip-through.gif"><img alt="ssue Five flip-through" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1689" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ssue-five-flip-through.gif?w=670"></a></p><p style="text-align:center;">Issue Five <em>flip through.</em></p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: What goes into the making of </strong><strong><i>Nat. Brut</i></strong><strong>, in terms of content?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> We’ve decided to limit the submission window to one month per issue (it was previously two-three months). Some of the submissions we get can be pretty rough. I was really surprised by how many men submit (and submit again and again and again) and how many of their stories are awfully terrible to women. We now have a team of readers who expertly sort through it all, though. In <i>Issue Five</i> we got one or two gems out of over a hundred submissions. We really rely on solicitations. Each issue is planned months in advance. We’ve already planned most of the content for <i>Issue Six</i> and we don’t even open for submissions until May! There’s just no other way to do it. So much work goes into the planning that we can never start too early. Each issue has a few recurring features, like the interview, Photo Box, and Early Edition, which make issues a little easier to plan.</p><p>One of the most fun and low stress parts of putting together an issue is curating our online feature A/V Corner. Axel and I dig through the public domain and pair a short silent film and a few old timey songs together. We can kind of take our time with it and it’s really collaborative between the two of us.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: What goes into the making of </strong><strong><i>Nat. Brut</i></strong><strong>, in terms of production?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> The production process for an issue of<i> Nat. Brut</i> is two-fold – first we tackle the physical issue, then we tweak the online issue to fit the aesthetic and add in the content bit by bit<i>. Issue Five</i> was extra intense since we launched a brand new website that I had to build from scratch. All of the design work for the magazine is done by me at my computer. I spend a lot of time in front a screen.</p><p>To make a print version a reality we get in touch with our printer before the issue is even designed. We use an eco-friendly printer in Canada called The Prolific Group. We talk over specs, then I spend hours and hours working on all the design aspects that go into the issue. Axel writes all the copy and does most of the copyediting. All the little blurbs in the issue introducing features and stuff are written by Axel. He also writes most of the copy for our posters. He’s the words and I’m the pictures! After we send it away there are always mistakes. The online version is a lot easier to deal with since we can fix those mistakes instantly.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: What’s the launch event?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>Aside from being a celebration of the release of<i> Issue Five</i>, during which copies of the magazine and all of our other merch will be easily accessible, this event is an opportunity for us to bring the gender disparities that underscore the editorial vision of the magazine into the forefront of a public conversation among women. First, we’re screening Christina Kolozsvary’s short film from<i> Issue Five</i>, <i>The Astronaut and the Star</i>, which is a brilliantly surreal treatment of the threat of femininity – it’s like surreal 90s cinema by way of a badass feminist. Then, I’ll be moderating a panel of some of our foremost female contributors who will talk about their experiences with, thoughts about, and advice on navigating and subverting gender disparities in their respective creative fields. Panelists include writer Koa Beck, comedian Phoebe Robinson, artist and writer Robyn O’Neil, and humorist (and former Lampy prez) Alexis Wilkinson. This event is a chance for <i>Nat. Brut</i> to do something I think is even more important than trying to balance the scales within the pages of the magazine – actively engaging in open conversation and rigorous intersectional discussion about what it means to be a woman in this time and place.</p><p><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/panelists.png"><img alt="Panelists" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1686" height="315" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/panelists.png?w=670&amp;h=315" width="670"></a></p><p style="text-align:center;">Issue Five <em>Release Event Panelists.</em></p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: If someone wanted to contribute, what could they do?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>As of now, there are four different ways one can contribute to <i>Nat. Brut</i>. First, you can of course submit to our printed issues. Submissions of all shapes, genres, and file formats are accepted during the months of May and October, and they can be directed to our <a href="https://natbrut.submittable.com/submit">online submission manager</a>. Second, you can contribute to <a href="http://natbrut.tumblr.com/">our blog</a>, which publishes a mixture of news, reviews, short essays, as well as its much beloved column, <a href="http://natbrut.tumblr.com/post/114216469594/nat-brut-images-of-the-week-from-nat-brut-issue">Nat. Brut Images of the Week</a>. Proposals for blog pieces may be directed to our inimitable blog editor, Sarah Hopkinson, at <a href="../../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#6e1d0f1c0f062e000f1a0c1c1b1a400d0103"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1a697b687b725a747b6e78686f6e34797577">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Luckily for the keen to contribute, <i>Nat. Brut </i>is a firm adherent to the age-old adage that collaboration is next to godliness. And so, if you have an idea for a project so wacky that only <i>Nat. Brut </i>could possibly pull it off, don’t be a stranger. Drop us a line at <a href="../../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#1d74737b725d737c697f6f6869337e7270"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b0d9ded6dff0ded1c4d2c2c5c49ed3dfdd">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Finally, you can always support <i>Nat. Brut</i> the old-fashioned way by purchasing an issue (or better yet, a subscription!) and by telling your friends about us. Over the past year, during which we launched a successful Kickstarter to finance our transition into print, we have been amazed by how social media has grown our readership by leaps and bounds. Just as it takes a village to raise a child, so too does it take a village (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_(internet)">“tribe”</a> is the more official term) to raise a literary magazine.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: What’s in Nat. Brut’s future?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>Well, in June we plan to participate in the <a href="http://newsouthfest.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">New South Festival of Literary Arts & Cartoonists</a>, hawking our wares, shaking hands, and spreading the good word of <i>Nat. Brut</i>. This <i>grand tour</i> in Austin will be followed by a series of summer projects. Our next issue is scheduled to hit coffee tables and select bookstores in late July. In August, we plan to launch what we are calling our “Artist Unresidency Program,” which will outfit one lucky writer with a bundle of bus tickets and gift cards to coffee shops across the country. We hope that this program will produce work heavily informed by North America’s built and natural landscapes as well as the lassitudes of chronic travel. Oh, and we’ve also begun our search to sponsor an endurance athlete, but as for our goals for that project, we’ll just let your imagination run wild.</p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>Aside from these fun side projects, we have big plans for <i>Issue Six</i>. Early Edition, our comics section, will be a gorgeous risograph printed booklet containing experimental comics work by female artists. I’m also planning something else fun as a supplement. Maybe a series of postcards interspersed throughout the issue. <i>Issue Six </i>will hopefully be mostly women, too, like <i>Issue Five</i>. I have the desire to eventually phase out work from cis-het white men within the pages of <i>Nat. Brut</i>. I know this is probably a controversial idea, but I don’t give a shit. With each issue of <i>Nat. Brut</i>, the more progressive we are, the stronger and more meaningful the work is. Representation among authorship matters. I also want to make it clear that we intentionally don’t market <i>NB</i> as a ladies mag or anything. I don’t want us to get pigeonholed and forgo male readership. I think, for us, it’s more effective to be an Art and Literary Magazine and not a Women’s Art and Literary Magazine so that more people stumble upon us. Men tend not to really read women writers. We want them to read <i>Nat. Brut</i> and, at least within the pages of the magazine, end up reading mostly women writers.</p><p class="wpa wpmrec">
