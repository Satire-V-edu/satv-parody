        <p><p><a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/image.jpg"><img alt="Image" class="aligncenter wp-image-1383" height="286" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/image.jpg?w=244&amp;h=286" width="244"/></a></p><p>Notes from 21 South Street<em> staff writer, Kiara Barrow ’16, talked with Advocate alum, Charlotte Lieberman ’13, to discuss<a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/relationship-advice/college-dating-screwed-up"> her recent article in Cosmopolitan</a> on college dating. In the story, Lieberman describes the symptoms and disease of a pervasive “whoever-cares-less-wins” paradigm, offering an analysis that includes anecdotal, statistical, and literature-based research. In this interview, Lieberman discusses her writing process, her Harvard experiences, and her own strategies for navigating diverse interests and opportunities as a young professional writer. </em></p><p><span id="more-1375"></span></p><p><strong>Your article offered a different and refreshing angle that resonated with a lot of readers. I was particularly interested in the part where you disagreed with the notion that “hookup culture” is the problem with college dating, which seems to be the angle that many people take.</strong></p><p>I don’t think you can simply diagnose “the problem” by saying that people are hooking up. Up until Hannah Rosin wrote the article “Boys on the Side” in <em>The Atlantic</em> as an off-shoot of her book <em>The End of Men</em>, people weren’t really examining the millennial “hookup culture” phenomenon with a particular focus on how stereotypical ideas of gender dynamics came into play. It was when I read Hannah Rosin, and when I found myself disagreeing with undercurrents in her argument, that I felt propelled to make my argument <em>not</em> about hookup culture. I wanted to think a little more about the emotional terrain of what I was talking about.</p><p><strong>Often, when people write about college dating, it is very gender based; women are either victims, or too much in charge. How did you navigate writing about college dating, without getting too caught up in the misleading and obvious ways in which gender seems to be part of it?</strong></p><p>I certainly identify as an ardent feminist, and living in the Co-op at Harvard—not to give the Co-op all the credit—exposed me to a community of people that was thinking about gender and sexuality way more critically than anyone else I had ever spent time with. I’d say one thing that was extremely difficult was balancing my desire to take advantage of the opportunity to write for a wide audience—<em>Cosmo </em>readers—with my understanding that this wide audience may not want to hear everything that I wanted to say.</p><p>The Hannah Rosin piece and the <em>New York Times</em> feature, “She Can Play that Game, Too,” that came out this past July, both laid out arguments that basically equate sexual liberation for women with the ability to “act like men.” That really didn’t sit well with me. When I sat down and really tried to digest these arguments, it occurred to me that I really wanted to collapse our cultural assumption that emotional vulnerability = weakness. If we continue to perpetuate the assumption that “acting like a man”—in the stereotypical, backward sense—is equivalent to empowerment, we are not going to get anywhere. This assumption still privileges men over women. What we’re fundamentally privileging right now is a patriarchal value system in which being an asshole is empowering, which it’s not.</p><p><strong>I was also wondering about the fact that you talk about Harvard somewhat—you’re clear about where you’re coming from and what your experiences at Harvard were like, but what about this issue is particular to college or Harvard?</strong></p><p>It was a kind of balance, as you point out. <em>Cosmo</em> was interested in the story being about Harvard specifically, but also wanted it to appeal to a wider readership by pointing out arguably “universal” dynamics. And I guess I also don’t think Harvard is that different. That being said, I think the final club culture is a bizarre version of fraternity culture, and it’s bizarre because it has heightened dynamics around privilege and exclusivity attached to it. I should also note that I was actually going to talk about the Advocate in the article, but that seemed way too niche for <em>Cosmo</em>’s readership. Although I think most of the people I dated in college were on the Advocate, including my current boyfriend. I’m happy to admit that to the Advocate blog; I don’t think that’s a surprise to anyone.</p><p>To answer your question about college in particular: the thing that sets “college dating” apart is that it’s a microcosm, so everything feels—and is—far more ramped up. College students are living, learning, eating, drinking, and sleeping around each other at all times. So by extension, everyone has the opportunity to be attracted to each other at all times; this creates the opportunity for people to act blasé, or “care less,” as if they have a million things to do all the time—and often, they do. At Harvard, people construct their identities so that they seem very intense in all these different facets of life, and that lends itself to a kind of convenient way of distancing yourself from people. I also think that the intense intellectualism at Harvard is a defense mechanism for so many people, myself included, and I think at the Advocate especially I found that—like, are we on the same page about Proust? We’re flirting because we’re talking about Proust.</p><p><strong>I want to hear about your process of writing and research.</strong></p><p>I started from personal experience and as drafts progressed I kind of created concentric circles of outreach. I sent an email to my close friends, and then my close-ish friends, and people from Harvard, and then people I had met once, and people in my Gmail contacts and then I was sending Facebook messages and having my Facebook status be, “Please reach out if you have a story about someone you were dating using text messages to make you feel insecure.” I did feel a little uncomfortable putting myself out there, but it was productive in the end. I will say that the subject matter really made people feel generous.</p><p>Then, I wanted to find a way to ground my argument with statistical research, something I could build upon with anecdotal research. I interviewed Lisa Wade, who coined the “whoever-cares-less wins” dynamic. She’s a professor at Occidental college. She was really tapping into this idea that acting stoic has been valued because it’s inflected by patriarchal values. And then I referenced a book, <em>Guyland</em>, which I actually read in a class called “Masculinites” in the Harvard WGS department. So the research was personal experience, generalization, asking questions about that generalization, constructing an argument, and then going back to weave in statistical and literature-based research to tie my ideas down into something more concrete.</p><p><strong>Now that you’ve been out of college for a little while, have you noticed things changing in terms of the way these things work? Do people adopt different attitudes once they have started to embark on things outside of Harvard?</strong></p><p>One of the things I miss most about college is constantly being surrounded by people who could be really cool. I’m a freelancer, so I don’t go to an office and I think that makes it feel less omnipresent. That said, I think that almost every single person I know who is living in New York right now is on Tinder or OKCupid, and online dating totally shifts things. It’s complicated because on one hand, the “whoever-cares-less-wins” thing is less of a problem, because everyone is there to meet someone so they’re admitting that they care. On the other hand, everyone can meet a million people in one click of the mouse. So, if they’re on a date with you, and then they don’t get back to you—maybe they’re on another date. There’s so much room for ambiguity that I think it makes the anxiety worse, in a sense.</p><p><strong>I want to hear more about how your writing career is going, and how you’ve made the transition from being a writer at Harvard to entering this new scene. There are so many different expectations about what is it like to have a creative career, what is it like to freelance, and what do you do if you want to write.</strong></p><p>I was put in touch with <em>Cosmo</em> through a connection and got the article by successfully making it through “an audition” of sorts. In the midst of my search for a “normal” 9-5 job, a bunch of other freelance writing opportunities started to accrue. In December, I got an email through the Harvard NYC alumni list from a woman who started a juice cleanse company in Shanghai and they needed an English copywriter. I secretly or not-so-secretly want to do something related to health and wellness at some point in my life, so I talked to her over Skype, and the opportunity totally fell into my lap. Then, while I was on a meditation retreat with my sister over New Year’s, I got another gig with the meditation author Sharon Salzberg working as her editorial assistant. In this sense, “putting myself out there” has really made all the difference.  I think that the main thing I gleaned from these past couple months has been about knowing how to characterize what your interests and skills are. I didn’t expect to make a living from writing, but it’s totally working. I’m not working in a literary environment, but I have my own time for my literary pursuits; I’m still writing tons of poetry, and I’m having my poetry published in April in the <em>Boston Review</em>. If anything, the fact that I’m doing something else gives me space to breathe and pursue it in a personal way. Writing can manifest itself in ways you might not have expected.</p><p><strong>I wanted to come back to what you said about being a feminist, which often seems like a crazy, complicated, challenging idea to be and talk about these days.</strong></p><p>What I’m really interested in doing as a young feminist is being earnest about it. I’m sick of the fact that irony seems to have to accompany anything serious. There’s a way in which the HBO show <em>Girls</em> is really smart, but it’s also extremely sardonic. It’s doing all of this work, but with the many ways that irony is at play it’s hard to even keep track of what’s ironic and what’s not. I think that it’s really important to believe that your ideas are interesting and valid, and therefore be unapologetic, and emotionally vulnerable, about that.</p><p>College gives you a stable environment, but in the world it’s easy to feel like your ideas exist in a vacuum. I didn’t think my article was good before it came out. You always feel insecure about your own work, but now that I have responses I’m excited to feel that I have my own interesting point of view. In the nonfiction world these days there is such a trend of defending your authority on a certain subject, but I think it’s a matter of really owning it. I’m not going to apologize for being a feminist, or say that it’s uncomfortable. I think that an earnest attitude really disarms people, and there’s a risk—but the benefits are super powerful. I’m really interested in representing things about our generation and being honest and emotionally grounded as opposed to always bringing it back to irony and humor. So we’ll see, I’m meeting with this agent on Tuesday and we’re going to try and discuss potential book ideas, because I want to keep up the momentum.</p><p><strong>That’s exciting.</strong></p><p>Yeah, I don’t really have ideas yet, but I will by Tuesday.</p><p> </p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
