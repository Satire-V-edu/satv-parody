<a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/4.jpg"><img alt="4" class="aligncenter wp-image-1388" height="324" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/4.jpg?w=324&amp;h=324" width="324"/></a>Notes from 21 South St is delighted to present the fourth installment of highlights from the TRIAL issue. Below, read the first part of the conversation between Indiana Seresin ’15  and Liza Batkin ’15, in which they <em>discuss Indiana’s nonfiction essay in the TRIAL issue, <a href="http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/against-new-feminism">“Against New Feminism</a></em><a href="http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/against-new-feminism">.”</a> </em></p><p><span id="more-1386"></span></p><p><strong>Liza Batkin: </strong>You refer in your essay to Zambreno’s disdain for “wifing,” and her assumption that, as you put it, “to wife is to lose.” I found your criticism of this assumption really compelling, and hoped that we could expand upon it. In particular I wonder what, in Zambreno’s view, defines the identity of the “wife” and the action of “wifing,” and how she understands the relationship between the wife’s socio-economic position, as the domestic laborer of the household, and her more socio-cultural role, as living in the shadow and service of her “genius” husband.</p><p><strong>Indiana Seresin: </strong>Well I think what you’ve pointed out is that Zambreno is juggling two different conceptions of “wife,” without clearly differentiating between them. The first is produced through discussion of the lives of artists, writers, significant cultural figures… “great men.” This is the idea that being the wife of a genius involves suspending your own creative work in order to facilitate theirs. Figures like Solphia Tolstaya, Tolstoy’s wife, come to mind. I read that she was the copyist for <em>War and Peace</em>–she copied out the entire manuscript seven times.</p><p>Anyway, this kind of wife is separated from the domestic drudgery associated with the other kind of wifedom. It is unlikely that Zelda Fitzgerald did much cleaning, and she would have had help raising their daughter. I read a description of this kind of cultural wife–I don’t know if that’s the right phrase, maybe “bourgeois wife” is better–in Hilton Als’ <em>White Girls</em>, in the first essay, “Tristes Tropiques.” Als is describing a friend who he refers to as SL, standing for Sir/Lady, who is black and male, and who falls in with a crowd of New York feminists in the 1970s. The quote is “SL became a wife, supporting a number of friends’ and lovers’ work while his own work took a backseat.” What I really like about the way Als uses this concept of “wife” is that he destabilizes it from being determined by sexuality and gender. It seems often that Zambreno is making this essentialist argument that because she is literally a wife/woman she is also the cultural “wife,” even though her husband, John, often seems to perform the wife role at least as much, if not more than she does.</p><p>This is something quite common to second wave feminism–the idea that because you are woman, you are automatically subjugated in some essential way. Whereas people writing feminist theory now, and writers like Als, refute that kind of thinking. In Als’ essay, S/L is a black man who becomes the wife to a group of assumedly white lesbian feminists.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>It’s almost as though Zambreno is conflating “wifing” the husband with “midwifing” the husband’s creative work.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, definitely. The issue of domestic/caring labour is actually very distinct from the cultural wife question, though Zambreno keeps them intertwined. Domestic labor is probably the most devalued category of work there is–maybe apart from sex work. I don’t think that people are ready to believe that the most important work done in this country is done primarily by poor women of color who are often immigrants.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>(Who are hired by the white, rich, successful “have it all” women who are happily reading Lean In and shattering the glass ceiling).</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, yes exactly. And not just the Sheryl Sandbergs of the world–that same line of thinking is in Heroines, is in that interview with Mary Gaitskill that I quote. It’s everywhere.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Part of the reason I bring up Sheryl Sandberg is that I went to this panel last night, called “New Directions in Feminism”; one of the panelists, Mikki Kendall, a black feminist with a large Twitter presence, was particularly critical, and rightly so, of Sheryl Sandberg’s breed of feminism. Sheryl Sandberg’s feminist agenda is to create more female billionaires. But, as you say, in order to work the hours that Sandberg works at Facebook probably requires extra help around the house, probably done by women, and probably by women of color. Kendall’s point was that the people who are harmed most by the oppressive, patriarchal structures that feminists are fighting against, are those who do not have a voice in the media; are not those who are left out of the boardroom, but those who are struggling to meet the most basic needs for themselves and their families, who can’t afford child support, who are legally compelled to raise a child they didn’t plan to have, etc. What we need, in Kendall’s (and my) view is to build from the bottom up, instead of relying upon a quasi-neoliberal hope in “trickle-down feminism.”</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, exactly. And not as some kind of favor or deliberate political correctness– but to find the solutions. Zambreno argues that, as a married female artist, she is in some kind of trap. Either she or John has to be the wife–either way that’s not fair. But when you take the time to listen to/read what non-dominant–queer, Third World, women of color–feminists have to say about this topic, you’ll see that this isn’t really a trap at all, or it doesn’t have to be.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I think we’ve sort of been circling around the second question we were going to discuss, which concerned Zambreno’s targeting of the modernist husbands for their wives’ oppression.</p><p>I’m kind of interested in jumping to the question of internet girl writing, and new feminism, if you’re game?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>It’s probably a flaw in my essay that I’m so dismissive of that genre, and call for things like “boundaries of quality,” given what we were just talking about–feminism that exists in the margins of dominant culture, that blossoms on the internet. Maybe I should start by saying that I’m actually quite critical of a lot of internet feminism too. The most alarming trend, to me, is how the relationship between online feminist theorizing and social capital allows for “calling out” to become a kind of currency. As flawed as that Michelle Goldberg piece is, this is something she picks up on. It’s treated better in an essay on the website on <a href="http://feministing.com/2013/12/20/on-cynicism-calling-out-and-creating-movements-that-dont-leave-our-people-behind/">Feministing</a>.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Yeah, in last night’s panel, though, Amber Frost, another online feminist, was trying to defend internet feminism by pointing out that the problems Michelle Goldberg was picking up on are simply inherent to radical politics, activism, organizing, and not to feminism necessarily— and it may be that the splintering and “calling out” that would happen anyway in any radical political context is just more condensed and apparent in an online domain like Twitter?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>In my opinion “calling out” isn’t so much the issue… it’s the kind of popularity/social currency dimensions of that practice. It becomes posturing, showing off, narcissistic and/or cliquey… I mean these things are bad in themselves, obviously, but the bigger problem to me is that it’s so reductive.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Reductive and besides the point— the fruits of internet battles are, as you say, “followers” and caché; reaping these rewards distracts from the real fruits of the real battles that we should be fighting….</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, exactly. Anyway, so that’s my biggest gripe with internet feminism. I have a different issue with Zambreno’s internet girl writing.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Right, I was just going to ask about that. Because it seems like her internet girl writing actually has little to nothing to do with the kind of internet feminism that Goldberg is targeting… Or am I wrong?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, very little. Kind of bizarrely so.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I was reading this great article by Emily Cooke, a senior editor at TNI, called The Semiautobiographers (<a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-semiautobiographers/" rel="nofollow">http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-semiautobiographers/</a>), and it begins with a mention of Zambreno’s interest in bulimic blogging…</p><p>“In the first post on her blog, Zambreno said that she was inspired by Dodie Bellamy’s Barf Manifesto (2008). Bellamy had decried the “oppressiveness” of the neatly constructed essay, lodging an appeal for chaotic, disorderly writing….And so, with Bellamy… as her disheveled [model], Zambreno “wrote and wrote and wrote and read and read and read and vomited it all up.”</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>I am not against that idea per se, though I am against the use of bulimia-as-metaphor, as I say in my essay. But I wish Zambreno (I guess Dodie Bellamy too) would interrogate more why that idea is tempting. Because my first thought is like, duh, of course that mode of writing is appealing. It’s easy. You can call the guidelines of structuring nonfiction essays masculine or patriarchal, but what about other kinds of structure? Emily Cooke talks about Allison Bechdel’s new, different, definitely non-patriarchal use of structure. It’s deliberate and complicated… not like vomiting at all.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>There’s also something tricky about the analogy that Bellamy makes between the “oppressiveness” of the neatly constructed essay and the “masculinity” of the same— to equate structure and form with masculinity is just to reify misogynist dialogues regarding the “nature” of women, their writing, their minds…</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yeah, totally.</p><p> </p><p><em>Illustration by Michelle Long ’16</em></p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
