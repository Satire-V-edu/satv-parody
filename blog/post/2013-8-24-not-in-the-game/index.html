We called the people that came in or out of it “missions” and pretended to spy on them. Anytime we saw someone walk past it we’d shrink behind a bush and watch them. <i>Where’s that mission going?</i>, we’d say. <i>He looks extra suspicious today.</i> The missions would glance back angrily at us. We’d giggle.</p><p><i>It’s so silly</i>, I used to think, <i>because people can’t be missions! </i>In my head I dragged out the words in the way children do when they think they are saying something funny, in the way that almost always makes it unfunny. <i>People</i> can’t be<i> missions! </i></p><p><span id="more-1095"></span></p><p>*</p><p>Playing pretend games, we used to interrupt ourselves and say, <i>Not in the game, I need to go to the bathroom. </i>It was ok, for some reason, to momentarily duck out of whatever fantasy we were inhabiting as long as we preposed it with “not in the game.” That was one of our rules, which were themselves without origin. When we laughed at the missionaries, I’m sure what we really wanted to do was walk up to them and say, <i>Not in the game, what on Earth are you doing? </i>Of course, we didn’t know that they were missionaries, or what missionaries did. We had been raised in atheism, in a secular city, in a world that at least pretends to be post-colonial. In all likelihood our parents had deemed evangelicalism—unlike, it is perhaps worth noting, sex or drugs or death—too much for our little light hearts to understand.</p><p>*</p><p>The Foreign Missions Club was a giant building, institution-like, with rows of windows suggesting uniform rooms. It was surrounded by protective rows of bushes, and had an entrance with a small parking space. Its name was painted across its front in large capital letters. The strangest thing about it was that it was so close to our house, and on a leafy street surrounded by other completely normal, coherent scenes: a two-story house with fancy cars in the driveway; a pair of council estates with people and dogs playing in the courtyard; a church, not much used; a bench where a certain homeless drunk liked to sit and talk to no one. This all made sense, and it bored us. It was what we saw on our way to the park every day. The Foreign Missions Club was also on the way to the park, but every day it was something different.</p><p>Approaching it, scampering along, we would turn and look at each other and say: <i>This could be it.</i> Part of the joke was that one day the missions would turn on us because they had found out that we had been spying on them. What exactly they would do was, like everything else, unclear. The reason why it was funny was that we knew they would never do it. We knew from the way they looked at us when we laughed at them, crouching behind a bush, whispering what I’m sure sounded to them like “missionary” and not “mission,” that we had the one-up. For kids, that was a priceless thrill.</p><p>*</p><p>Years later I came back to find that the Foreign Missions Club had drably rebranded; it was no longer called the Foreign Missions Club, but The Highbury Center. Everything about this was wrong. Highbury is the name of my neighbourhood, and the Foreign Missions Club’s new name therefore appeared to be claiming some kind of relevance, even centrality, within the community. How could that be, though, when everything about the building was bizarre, secretive, incongruous with its surroundings? The other problem was the new name’s neutrality. <i>The Highbury Center</i> could have been anything: a doctor’s clinic, a youth center, an office of the local government.</p><p>What the Foreign Missions Club actually was — what it still is — is a hotel for missionaries. There was a time when evangelical protestant missionary workers could stay there for free; these days they get a discounted price. It was and continues to be advertised as a place of respite for all those who fall on the evangelical spectrum: Christian aid workers, doctors working in mission hospitals, as well as the old-fashioned types whose sole mission is to spread the gospel. A few times I have considered going in to ask a few questions in a friendly, neighbourhood sort of way. But I doubt I’ll ever do it. Our joke with the Foreign Missions Club was always doomed to be a one-sided game.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
