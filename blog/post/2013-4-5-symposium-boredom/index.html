Fever is a nightmarish house party that leaves the body ravaged and scarred from the inside out.” Perhaps he is right. But our true demon is not so gregarious. It arrives quietly, and it takes root. It is heralded not by the furious tremors of a coming surge, but by the ominous toll of a sluggish hour. The tick of a clock. The heavy sigh. The restless fluttering of an impatient foot.</p><p>In his autobiography, Roland Barthes recalls “A panic boredom, to the point of distress: like the kind I feel in panel discussions, lectures, parties among strangers, group amusements: wherever boredom can be seen. Might boredom be my form of hysteria?” His pairing of boredom with madness is not new. The thought crosses millennia of literary musing, philosophical inquiry and spiritual belief. Boredom, whether conceived as a critical attunement, psychological state, existential <i>malaise</i>, physical impairment, scholarly illness or personal weakness, was once thought to afflict those beset by a demonic envoy called acedia. Evagrius the Solitary, the fourth century Christian Desert Father, first described the fiend. Evagrius lived amidst his fellow monks in the Desert of Cells, the desolate sprawl of arid land south of Alexandria, and he envisioned a demon that latched itself to pious minds at the very moment the sun had reached its apex, when the hottest hour seemed to drag for an eternity, when the temptations of modern life in Alexandria sang out most plaintively. Distracted and disgusted with their repetitive work — the copying of scripture, the weaving of reed baskets — the monks lapsed and gave into their demons. Their boredom was a failure before God.</p><p><span id="more-827"></span></p><p>Acedia, the worst of Evagrius’ Eight Evil Thoughts, was the most perfidious of all sins. When John Cassian, one of Evagrius’ students in North Africa, brought the principles of desert monasticism to fifth century Marseilles, the demon followed. “This is akin to dejection,” he writes, lamenting the sometimes agitated, sometimes listless condition of his disquieted monks, “especially disturbing to a monk about the sixth hour, like some fever which seizes him at stated times, bringing the burning heart of its attacks on the sick man at usual and regular hours.” A regular fever, acedia: a virus bound to its human vessel by the very monotony of his repeated tasks, a possession without the sweet delirium of a reverie, without the excitement of a skirmish of the soul.</p><p>“It renders him slothful and immobile in the face of all the work to be done,” Cassian continued. “It does not allow him to stay still in his cell or to devote any effort to reading.” His followers were not beset by desert heat or self-imposed isolation. They lived amidst one another, with communal values and shared tasks, in the relative comfort of an enclosed monastery in the south of France. Yet their attention wandered, their spiritual pursuits constantly frustrated by a dull dissatisfaction with the ordinary, the familiar, the interminable tasks of everyday life. Their work was divided between physical tasks and mental demands. Concentration became a virtue of the elite, the disciplined, and the holy, while distraction signaled the sick, the lazy, and the weak-willed.</p><p>Through the first millennium, Cassian’s acedia evolved into many different forms, notably becoming pathologized, exorcised of its demonic undertones, during the Renaissance. It became <i>melancholia</i>, the excess of black bile, the bilious byproduct of overworked scholars and frustrated alchemists, and, when made visible, an elitist expression of unbridled genius and tortured creativity. But has the illness been eradicated? How long does the demon reign?</p><p>In 2010, two scientists at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health published a study that found, based on the responses to a 1980s questionnaire of London civil servants, that “those who report being bored are more likely to die younger than those who are not bored.” Perhaps they were also right to conclude that “the state of boredom is almost certainly a proxy for other risk factors,” a gateway mood to self-destructive behaviors and unhealthy habits. But perhaps boredom is more maddening than madness. It’s what makes us cry out for something to rekindle our belabored minds. In a single turn, fever becomes our guardian. It is the violent storm breaking doldrums’ spell. And it is good.</p><p style="text-align:center;" rel="text-align:center;">♠</p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>TWO</strong></p><p>When I was small I went to church every Sunday. It was a late Mass, comparatively, starting at 10:30 am, and yet we always seemed to be late. Hair ties askew and Mary Janes unbuckled, we’d slink into the nave amid the opening hymn, nudging through the pews to where my grandmother had saved us a spot, knowing we’d arrive at some point. She needed to save a spot: the services were fuller then.</p><p>I never minded the songs and readings; the homilies usually held my attention. But it was barely 11:00 when the priest tucked his notes back into his robes and descended from the lectern. Forty-five minutes remained (this Mass was late but long): forty-five minutes that, every Sunday, were inexorably the same. Preparation of the Gifts; Prayer over the Gifts; Preface Dialogue; the Holies and Acclamations and Prayers. I knew exactly what was coming and exactly how long it would take to get there — an excruciating knowledge when trapped within a pew. I usually hadn’t eaten anything, so there was also that wide, gaping ache of morning hunger, freezing my circulation before it made it to my fingers and toes. The incense made me woozy as the congregation muttered together, words whose cadence I could mimic but whose meaning I could only guess at until, later, I would see the prayers themselves written out in confirmation class. Time unrolled like a thick skein of yarn, caught in its own snags. I was endlessly, mindlessly bored.</p><p>In a certain sense, of course, this was the point. There is a relief in ritual, a comfort in repetition. Amid the cacophony of modern life, to chant is to withdraw, seeking solace detached from thought.</p><p>Boredom, then, succeeds at this precise detachment. In the medieval period, professor Stephen Greenblatt tells us in <i>The Swerve, </i>monasteries occupied an uncertain position: they were the repositories of knowledge, the copiers of ancient texts, but also the champions of a precise catechism that left little room for intellectual questioning. Monks were meant to copy down manuscripts letter by letter, without thinking, without debating the terms of ancient thought. The rooms were always silent but for the scratching of their quills. Inevitably, then, the monks would slip into lethargy. Quite simply, they were bored. Priests in charge called this the “noonday demon,” an acedia springing precisely from the prayerful reading to which the monks were meant to subscribe. Here in the monasteries, holy contemplation could easily become mechanical boredom; the difference between the two was indeed negligible.</p><p>We’ve become very good at negating the need to think about this distinction. “Prayerful reading” in a secular age has detached itself, to a certain extent, from the confines of medieval cloisters, finding its way into meditation and self-help rather than into the rituals of a Mass. Boredom has, some might say, been similarly banished. We have lost one of our country’s most fervent surveyors of this phenomenon in the death of David Foster Wallace, who as a child watched six hours of television per day. “Not just Muzak in dull or tedious places anymore,” he wrote in his unfinished <i>The Pale King, </i>“but now also actual TV in waiting rooms, supermarkets’ checkouts, airports’ gates, SUVs’ backseats. Walkmen, iPods, BlackBerries, cell phones that attach to your head.” People seek stimulation, Wallace suggests, to distract them from a deeper kind of pain than “dullness.” We have, he claimed — because he saw it in himself — a profound fear of silence, of shutting out the noise. Because perhaps once we do the reality of things will rear its terrifying head, and we will have to face whatever it is that the clamor drowns out.</p><p>What if boredom becomes necessary, though — impossible to escape? In some ways <i>The Pale King </i>is an attempt to follow this proposition to its the logical conclusions. In the stale monotony of the Midwestern IRS, its employees seem to want to go crazy but somehow cannot. Lane Dean pictures himself running around during his ten-minute break with ten cigarettes in his mouth, speaking in tongues, waving his hands; but he spends the break sitting, facing the clock, counting the seconds until he goes back to work. One whole chapter is composed of characters turning the page (literally: “She turned the page. He turned the page.” Pages and pages of this.).</p><p>But there is, Wallace seems to suggest, a certain nobility in what the IRS employees must achieve. “To function effectively in an environment that precludes everything vital and human. To breathe, so to speak, without air.” If you can become comfortable with boredom, live with it, you will, according to Wallace, be alright. As he said in his famous Kenyon commencement address, it is this embrace of boredom, the unsexy embrace of awareness in the everyday (<i>this is water—this is water)</i>, that makes getting through each moment possible, and worth it.</p><p>To strip down the noise, to face the threat lurking under boredom’s surface, and to emerge on the other side: These become the pillars of a new kind of catechism. It is a catechism that embraces boredom both in its superficial dullness and its existential despair. Boredom, when used correctly, becomes not a detractor from meaning but a prerequisite for the same. As scholar Michael Raposa has written, it is a metaphorical midwife: the “pallid half-darkness that sometimes lingers” before the dawning of the light. Boredom is thus elevated to a spiritual plane, one embedded in the <i>The Pale King</i>’s prose — even if Wallace himself ultimately couldn’t subscribe to the framework he so articulately mapped out.</p><p style="text-align:center;">♣</p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>THREE</strong></p><p>Jørgen Leth and Ole John’s film <i>66 Scenes from America</i>, created in 1981, includes a “tableau” called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejr9KBQzQPM" target="_blank">“Burger, New York.”</a> Seated at a long, black table in front of a dull, gray wall, Andy Warhol removes a Burger King Whopper box from its paper bag, opens it, unwraps the burger, and briefly struggles with getting ketchup out of a glass bottle of Heinz onto the wrapper (“It doesn’t come out,” he mutters). Warhol then proceeds to eat the hamburger, dipping it into the ketchup every so often; halfway through the 4’30” minute scene, he removes the top of the bun and folds the rest of the burger in half, and after four more bites Warhol puts it down. He wipes his mouth and tidies up, and after close to a minute of silence, says to the camera: “Uh, my name is Andy Warhol and, uh, I just finished eating uh, a hamburger.”</p><p>Watching the king of pop do anything on television is, at first, amusing. That’s the point. We watch the most mundane task all the way through because the artist has attained a celebrity status. There’s an element of absurdity, too, that Leth, John and Warhol would take on such a filmic production. And perhaps something grotesque about it as well, a kind of cannibalism — the “consumer artist” consuming one of the most prevalent consumer products. On top of this, the camera digests this scene for the audience’s viewing pleasure. If “cannibalism” is too strong a word, then we might at least agree on “oversaturation”: Warhol the icon represents the American individual steeped in — better yet, soaked through by — the commercial market.</p><p>It is, ironically, this oversaturation that produces the boredom that we eventually feel, that we see Warhol feeling, that permeates the long, black table and the dull, gray wall. The commercial world’s assault on the consumer, originally a source of stimulation, distraction, temptation, satisfaction, results in numbness. We are bored of this bombardment and yet continue to go through the motions, conditioned, like Pavlov’s dog, to salivate whenever we see the phrase “I’m lovin’ it” — a phrase forever linked to the crunch of a golden chicken nugget.</p><p>Warhol eats, but he does not <i>enjoy</i> what he eats; his chewing is accompanied by a deadpan stare. If his boredom wasn’t apparent before, it clearly shows when he takes half the bun off the hamburger, wanting to finish as quickly as possible. We realize suddenly that Warhol’s final statement is slightly, but crucially, untrue. He says, “I just finished eating, uh, a hamburger,” but there are several bites that he leaves on his wrapper, which he crumples up and throws away. He doesn’t finish the hamburger; what he means to say is that he’s finished <i>with</i> the hamburger. Warhol’s boredom verges on disgust and results in waste.</p><p>The metaphor of the consumer is apt because, just as we can get full from food, we can feel overloaded by brands and advertisements. We might call it “oversatisfaction” — the nauseating or soporific sensation of the “food coma” is akin to the glaze that comes over one’s eyes while looking through the tabloids at the grocery store. “Burger, New York” hints at the former but depicts the latter: The reason Warhol doesn’t finish the burger isn’t that he’s physically full; rather, he’s put off by the idea of continuing on, of consummating the act of utter non-satisfaction. This is not yet disgust, for disgust would be real emotion, outside boredom’s realm. Instead, Warhol’s nausea triggers the question, “Should I finish this hamburger?”, the answer being another question, “Do I care?”</p><p>The only glimmer of personality shows toward the beginning of the scene, when Warhol shakes the bottle of Heinz, muttering, “It doesn’t come out.” This frustration, though, is coupled with a wry grin from the artist, as if he’s glad to be shaken from his doldrums. Dissatisfaction is a flicker of life, an ironic pleasure quickly smothered by more concentrated boredom.</p><p>From oversaturation to non-satisfaction we come full-circle. I’m reminded of a piece of panda trivia I learned from a zookeeper at the San Diego Zoo: She said, in effect, that a panda excretes what it eats. To be clear: Its waste is literally a heap of chewed-up bamboo. In essence, the act of consumption is the only thing that distinguishes a panda’s food from its shit. Content to pulverize bamboo for what little nutrition it provides and to sleep, energyless and alone, for the rest of the day, pandas are probably one of the most bored creatures on the planet. We, too, wait for the next meal, following Warhol’s lead, his face stretched like cellophane, his hair bleached into oblivion.</p><p style="text-align:center;">♥</p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>FOUR</strong></p><p>Rather than reflect on Facebook’s monopolization of contemporary boredom, as I was initially inclined to do, I’d like to look back at boredom’s pre-digital manifestations. Two historical prototypes capture my interest, each gendered, and both ripe for what Heidegger called a “confrontation with time”: the male soldier and the domestic female.</p><p>In her recently published book, <i>Modernism, Feminism, and the Culture of Boredom</i>, Allison Pease suggests that much of literary modernism was essentially shaped by female boredom. She claims that illustrating bored women characters was a way for writers of the early 1900s, like Woolf, Richardson and Sinclair, to voice their discontent with a suffocating gender-hierarchy. Female boredom was a very real phenomenon, instigated by very real societal subordination; to depict it in fiction, Pease argues, was a form of political dissent.</p><p>While literature from the early twentieth century presented a feminine species of boredom, a masculine species thrived elsewhere. In <i>Enduring Military Boredom: From 1750 to the Present</i>, Bard Maeland and Paul Otto Brunstad verify via historical case study the cheeky factoid that military service is 99% boredom and 1% terror. The book reveals that boredom did not belong to the ottoman alone; the vacuous sentiment haunted many a soldier waiting in a trench for his next employment or undergoing a long journey via submarine.</p><p>A condition of the same name afflicted he who represented his nation and she who was denied the right to take part in it. Boredom in these histories is no negative vacuum; rather, it is embedded within politics and lies at the heart of war and the family structure.</p><p>In the late nineteenth century, greater access to education had provided women with the intellectual means to succeed, but political and social constraints prevented them from so doing. Pease suggests that it was this growing tension between a woman’s internal self-realization and her steady external repression that resulted in boredom. Not only were women forced to remain inactive, Pease further proposes, but they willingly submitted themselves to recumbence as a form of respite: In <i>The Pastor’s Wife</i>, Elizabeth von Armin writes, “Ingeborg’s mother had found the sofa as other people find salvation …. she had simply discovered in it a refuge.” Along these lines, Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel diagnoses pathological boredom as the state that arises when a “subject seeks to be freed by means of a <i>passive</i> experience from a tension which set in because he was afraid of his own <i>active</i> impulses.” A woman’s energy was directed into passive boredom when her inner desire to act was unsatisfied by the outside world.</p><p>Not unlike the housewife, the soldier is appointed a specific social place. War suspends his agency, donning him responsibility and purpose. But not always is his purpose called to task: While the soldier is often busy, he is also often not. In a sketch of Private John Ball waiting for the Battle of the Somme, David Jones writes: “a penetrating tedium, a boredom that leadened and oppressed, making the spirit quail and tire, took hold of them, as they went to their first fatigue.” The image of the bored soldier is striking: One assumes, wrongly, that the meaningful title of <i>soldier</i> immunizes its beholder from feelings of listlessness. As Maeland and Brunstad report, consigned young men found the reality likewise striking. While one young man, for example, sought “the tickle of being close to death in order to combat his existential emptiness and boredom,” he soon discovered the same boredom in the trenches where he awaited that deathly tickle.</p><p>For both the female domestic and the male combatant, boredom, even when engendered of specific circumstance, bore existential consequence. Reinhard Kuhn says chillingly of the housewife’s ennui that “this is a condition that has no foreseeable or inevitable end but death.” The connection to the soldier here — whose boredom is literally broken by deathly engagement — is clear. Leonard Woolf suggests moreover that the soldier’s waiting would not be cured by the resumption of action, insofar as the act of waiting simply revealed the “negative emptiness and desolation of personal and cosmic boredom” that characterized the war in totality. In this vision, boredom is not a temporary sentiment, but rather a pathological state that alludes to life’s conclusive stillness.</p><p>While boredom may remind us of the end, however, it need not itself <i>be</i> the end. Indeed, boredom is often conceived of as a progenitor of creativity. In the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, “Boredom is not an end-product, is comparatively rather an early stage in life and art. You’ve got to go by or past or through boredom, as through a filter, before the clear product emerges.” For Virginia Woolf and May Sinclair, Fitzgerald’s words ring true. And even the soldier was known to have creative breakthroughs, though his measures were often desperate. I will end with a section from Paul Fussell’s <i>In The Great War and Modern Memory</i> that illustrates one such creative breakthrough. The episode, which depicts an American POW in a German Stalag, is both familiar and alien; it calls to mind how universal and recognizable boredom is, how contagious it can be, and how curious are its expressions:</p><p> “[He] counted the barbs in one section of the barbed wire fence and then estimated the total number of barbs around the encampment. When he announced this number, his fellow kriegies not only didn’t consider him mad, they formed teams to check him out with a barb-by-barb count.”</p><p class="wpa wpmrec">
