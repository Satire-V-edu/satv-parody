    <article>
        <p><p>It was raining when Rachel learned she would never become pregnant. She preferred to look at
the rain instead of the fluorescent light of the doctor’s office, the syringes, the biohazard signs,
letting the doctor’s monotone and the grind of water pellets hitting the window become white
noise. Her mom was in the corner. Her eyes said “Sorry, honey,” but her lips were pursed,
silently saying “Shit. Shit. Shit.”!
</p><p>Physically, nothing had changed. Rachel could not carry a child because she was a child
herself. But she had wanted to have a child, eventually, in the abstract, like how a kindergartner
wants to be an astronaut. She smiled in spite of herself when toddlers stumbled by and picked
out her favorite names names like Tessa and Grace that she would save for future reference.
She knew that soon she would get older, and she would lengthen while her hips widened, and
then she would get older, and she would find herself cutting the crust off sandwiches, driving
other, smaller bodies to soccer practice or gymnastics or violin, and then she would get older,
and her body would be folding into itself, barren again. She just skipped a few steps, that’s all.</p><p>
It's the things we don’t plan for that kill us, she heard someone say, once. Except that this
would not kill her, the doctor said. “It’s only a parasite. The only things she has to worry about
are a few stomachaches after a large meal. It doesn’t harm the body in any way, it just keeps
her from having enough nutrients to ovulate,” The doctor is the kind of person who gets nervous
when he talks to children so he talks like a textbook and won’t look Rachel in the eye. Her
mother asked if there was anything they could do. The doctor shook his head and coughed off a
grimace. “It won’t die until she does.”<br><br>
On the way to the doctor’s office they talked about her birthday. It wasn’t for a few days but her
mother had brought home the cake that morning, still enclosed in its white cardboard box. She
wondered if she would feel older. Now the way home was long and silent, but for the rain and
her mother’s occasional sighs. Rachel found herself looking at the creases folding around her
mother’s face. It made her look like she was holding something back, like the wrinkles around
her lips were keeping her from speaking. Rachel held her abdomen lightly, with one hand.<br></p><p>When she got home she went straight to the bathroom. Her mother didn’t stop her. She looked
at her stomach in the mirror for a while. She thought it might have gotten bigger, but it was hard
to tell; her stomach was only slightly bloated, like the curve of an almond. Perhaps this is how
her mom felt when she was pregnant with Rachel. Perhaps it was not that she would never
become pregnant, it was that she would be pregnant forever, but with an insect, a worm, an eel.
She thought about her birthday. People would ask her if she felt older. The cake was in the
refrigerator, chocolate with pink frosting. She sat in the darkness of an empty kitchen and ate it
with a spoon. </p></p>
