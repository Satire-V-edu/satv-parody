    <article>
        <p><p class="p1"><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/rk_ms12034.jpg"><img alt="RK_MS12034" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1618" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/rk_ms12034.jpg?w=670"></a></p><p style="text-align:center;"><em>Rote Kapelle (Pour) #3, 2012, unique silver gelatin print on fiber-based paper, 147 x 101 cm </em></p><p class="p1">Where artists come from is oftentimes inseparable from who they are. It is perhaps because art-making is necessarily a deeply personal practice; understanding an artist’s body of work in its entirety requires that we put him in the context of history, in relation to the city that he lived and worked, the people that he conversed with, and the works of art from which he drew inspiration. Naturally it’s difficult to pin down the factors that transformed artists as who they are now. The cliché that each human being brings a universe of his own resonates profoundly with artists. But if art-making is a personal pursuit in the end, where one has to carve his own path for creativity, what does it mean to study art in an institutional setting? Can art be taught?<br>
<span id="more-1617"></span></p><p class="p1">Berlin-based artist Matt Saunders thinks so. A graduate of Harvard’s Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) program, he went on to study at Yale and moved to Germany in 2002. Now he’s back in Cambridge, teaching painting and printmaking along with his former teachers. I met up with Matt in Berlin, in his well-lit studio in Prenzlauer Berg and his favorite restaurants in Mitte, to discuss what it means to study and teach painting.</p><p class="p1"><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/harvardundergrad-polaroid-scan.jpg"><img alt="HarvardUndergrad Polaroid scan" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1619" height="694" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/harvardundergrad-polaroid-scan.jpg?w=670&amp;h=694" width="670"></a></p><p class="p1" style="text-align:center;"><em>Polaroids from undergraduate VES studio, circa 1996-97</em></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Harry Choi: Did you come to Harvard thinking that you’d like to study art? </strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Matt Saunders: Not particularly. I came here thinking that I would do something along the lines of philosophy, and I don’t think I was even aware of the VES department. Of course I was interested in art, but I knew that I wanted to end up in a university instead of an art school. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>HC: Why was that? </strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">MS: The idea of an art school, where you go through rigorous “traditional” training, didn’t appeal to me as a high school senior. Two semesters of drawing followed by two semesters of painting, that kind of rigid curriculum. I felt like the most interesting work for me didn’t come from that direction.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>HC: What kind of works were you interested in when you first started making art?</strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">MS: I signed up for art classes in middle school after going to the National Gallery of Art and being fascinated with Jasper John’s painting <i>Fool’s House</i> . I grew up in Baltimore; I wouldn’t say that I was “surrounded” by art in my childhood, but also found a lot of support there once I looked.</span></p><p class="p1"><strong>HC: Then you came here and studied with Ellen Phelan, who is very much a “pure” painter. </strong><strong>How was it to study painting as an undergraduate in the late 90s? What was going on in the department?</strong></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">MS: I didn’t really take much in the way of painting courses as an undergraduate; it was just before Nancy Mitchnick came in. (Nancy really occupied the painting studios and brought them to life.) I was taking classes in printmaking, 2-D/ 3-D Design and photography. I did a little bit of painting in Annette Lemieux’s class, but it was my thesis project that really got me into the practice of painting. It was a series that I developed out of the printmaking work that I was doing at the time. I started working closely with Ellen Phelan.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She is someone who really changed my life. Ellen received that very rigorous, old-school art education, but structured her classes much more loosely. She introduced the notion of skills and technical knowledge not being an end by themselves, but as part of a bigger practice that you build as an artist. She didn’t believe in hierarchizing the learning of art but still – more than is often in vogue – taught some real skills.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>HC: What about VES was formative in your personal development as an artist?</strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">MS: VES was a fantastic balance between medium-specific skills and the flexibility to play around with ideas. I really thrived in that unstructured environment; it helped me figure out my own voice, and find my way through the various interests I had, from art history to early books to film. And because my paintings were a way of putting together these interests, I was able to think a lot about what it meant to be a painter in a period when it had been historically uncool. Then there was a resurgence of painting in New York in the late 90s and early 2000s, with artists like John Currin, Elizabeth Peyton, and Amy Sillman receiving more attention. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>HC: Was it the department’s direction that informed your practice as a young artist? Or was it the general current of history that produced such an atmosphere on campus?</strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">MS: It’s a bit of both. There was something about Harvard in general that affected me. At the time (I’d hazard perhaps more so than now) there was a great emphasis on a liberal arts education. The whole line about learning how to think was very palpable in the atmosphere. I went to school in the middle of the Clinton era, when the American economy was booming, and people were relatively relaxed about life after college. I think that was one reason why I was able to focus on developing my work practice. It’s not like I wasn’t concerned about my future; I was freaking out about everything, but I think deep inside I knew I could be alright.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>HC: How was it to study painting in that strange era of painting renaissance? Yale MFA’s division along disciplines is quite notable in that regard; what was going on in the painting program? </strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">MS: I decided to go to Yale instead of Columbia because Yale gave me the precise challenge of putting my work in the context of painting, though Columbia was seemingly more in sync with my interests: it was a smaller program that had more interdisciplinary offerings. Going to Yale meant that I would be sharing studio space with twenty-or-so people that self-identified as painters. And it was quite exciting to think about that—although my work was, and still is, very much informed by painting, I didn’t really know a lot of pure painters. My friends from VES were making all different kinds of work. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I  was working on paintings at first, transitioned into film and photography for a little bit, and then worked on paintings for my final show. At Yale I developed more foundations for my practice. I was interested in making things by hand, and maintaining a balance between on one hand caring about and picking up the tools of painting, but on the other letting work be medium free, self-directed and open-ended.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>HC: And is it something that you keep in mind as you teach painting as well?</strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">MS: Very much so. I believe that you develop your ideas just as much through distracted time or working in seemingly non-productive ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You do your best thinking when you’re not trying to think. You often just need to pick up something and do it, because it’s a good use of your time and it can lead to many wonderful things. And the best way to get around to art-making in college is to sign up for art classes and do these assignments. And they are not stupid because you can do something else with them. It’s much better than locking yourself up thinking that you’re good at something and remaining at that level without challenging yourself. You end up becoming bad at it because you identify with your talent too much. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>HC: How do you envision your role as a teacher? What are your goals and aspirations?</strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">MS: After I graduated from college, I worked as a teaching assistant for a VES thesis workshop that Peter Schjeldahl taught. And he said something quite memorable: “All of the artists that I knew were terrible students, so you all must be terrible artists.” </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course this sounds cliché and abrasive, but it’s not entirely untrue. I want to help students understand that the straight road is often not the best road; learning how to become an artist is a totally different thing because you shouldn’t be doing what everyone else is doing. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>HC: And now that you’ve finished formal education and now teaching students, what do you think was the most important factor in your development as an artist?</strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">MS: Really, the most important thing is time. I remember living in New York when I was twenty-five, and thinking that I was ready for prime time, when I was <i>really</i> not. You go through cycles of life, for me every five years or so, and in each cycle you have different passions and obsessions. And learning how to become an artist is learning the intensity of it—making bad work, looking back at your bad work, but somehow continuing to make things. You can’t write the great novel thinking that you’re going to write the great novel. That’s what I would like to tell any young artist.</span></p><p class="p1"><em>Images courtesy of <a href="http://www.ves.fas.harvard.edu/saunders.html"> Matt Saunders</a></em><br></p><p class="wpa wpmrec">
