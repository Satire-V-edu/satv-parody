    <article>
        <p><p>As the augurs would have it, literature is not long for this world. Phillip Roth gives the novel twenty five years; others see that as optimistic. Many are too busy reading to have time for these doomsayers, and the greatest portion of all have never cared. Nevertheless, these fears raise a question well worth asking: What would remain of a world without good books?</p><p>Tochtli is the seven-year-old narrator of <em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em>, the  debut novella by Juan Pablo Villalobos. He’d be something like Lewis Carroll’s Alice, had Alice grown up in a fortified desert compound near the Santa Teresa of Roberto Bolaño’s <em>2666</em>. For Tochtli is the son of Yolcaut, <em>narcotraficante</em>, chief of the most macho gang for eight kilometers. He plays console games, collects hats and memorizes samurai films. He finds books useless, but reads the dictionary every evening. He wants, more than anything, a liberian pygmy hippopotamus. He’s funny – he has the proverbial babe’s mouth.  Around him and above his childish understanding, his father’s bloody kingdom waxes and wanes, disgorging headless corpses and macabre enigmas. Tochtli sees all of it. “Think the worst,” says Yolcaut, “and you’ll be right.”</p><p><span id="more-25"></span></p><p><em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em> is a spare, arid novel, severely circumscribed in its lexicon and the depth of its characters. Tochtli is the only real character in the book. Yolcaut is a cartoonish gangster. Mazaztin, the tutor – with his tirades about the hegemony of the gringos and his habit of living with Amerindian tribes – is a satirical figure of the Latin American radical left. The other characters – a few guards, a gardener, a cocaine-snorting gringo named Paul – are no more substantial. But this eerie flatness is rather more what makes than what breaks Villalobos’ book. For <em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em> is a fable of the world without literature, of the world made false and shallow by lack of the narrative werewithal to plumb its more difficult depths. It is superficial because it is about the struggle against superficiality, about the spectacle of inadequate expression grappling with a dark and complicated world that lies ever beyond descriptive reach.</p><p>Mario Vargas Llosa writes in <em>Why Literature?</em> that an individual who does not read, or reads little, or reads only trash, has an impediment. Such an individual – such a world – is impoverished not only in words but in thought, “for the simple reason that ideas, the concepts through which we grasp the secrets of our condition, do not exist apart from words.” Tochtli tells us he’s precocious, or at least that he is thought to be. He is proud of many things, above all, his vocabulary, which includes such words as “sordid,” “disastrous,” “pathetic,” “devastating,” and “immaculate.” But it becomes clear that Tochtli does not know many words at all; least of all the ones he would need to discuss the traumas of his youth. He has only the words he knows, and each of them begins to bear a greater share of his voice’s expressive weight. Thus we learn that both wearing hats and the guillotine are “immaculate”; that there is “sordidness” both in the growth of hair and in a lonely life; that the memory, boredom and the nation of Mexico are each “disastrous” in their way.</p><p>What is left when a certain complexity of expression ebbs away is something flatter, more enigmatic, more akin to myth. A nod to this can be found in the symbolic, Nauhatl names of the characters, the allusions to Aztec mythos and sacrifices of human flesh. Villalobos’ novella, like Llosa’s essay, suggests that a world without literature is necessarily a world of superstition and myth. Language becomes incantatory, rather than revelatory, and in doing so approaches its own senility.</p><p>Yet, in the struggle for voice caused by limitation, there is also a new birth, a tearing of language from its frame. There are many things Tochtli cannot say, it is true, but there are also many things he can say that we cannot. The revelatory power of language lives on in neologism and creative misuse: thus we learn that politicians are “people who make complicated deals,” and that orifices are “holes you make in people so their blood comes out.” What <em>Down the Rabbit Hole </em>illustrates so aptly is that language can indeed die, but that the constraints of its obsolescence are also the seeds of its rebirth.</p><p>By Julian Lucas ’15</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
