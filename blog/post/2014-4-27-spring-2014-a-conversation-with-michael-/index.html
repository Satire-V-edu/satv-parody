I spent the summer living on the Harvard Business School campus. There are lots of rabbits over there and, if you pay attention to the animals, you’ll see there are squirrels and rabbits and that they don’t occupy the same space. I would come home at night having just seen five, six rabbits every day. And they’re just so cute. So it was this experience of seeing them, getting to have this different geography of Harvard—of where particular animals live and don’t live.</p><p>CV: I hadn’t even thought about Harvard, though that may tie into my next question, which on the “ferrovitreous cistern collecting/ dimensionless shadows of European attitudes.” The poem is so focused on the natural, mystic world, and then there’s this striking image of human presence.</p><p>MTF: I think what comes to mind visually is Widener Library, particularly on the second and third levels where you can see this brilliant light coming through thee windows in the interior courtyard, which formerly were exterior courtyards. I was trying to write based on observations I made daily while walking around in Cambridge and I think that’s why there is this particular man-made object in contrast to the natural objects. And the word “ferrovitreous”— I approached this poem with an exercise from Jorie Graham. Take any book and go through it page-by-page, writing down a list of interesting words. The wordlist for this poem came from <em>The Railway Journey </em>by Wolfgang Schivelbusch. It’s an historical consideration of how the railroads in Europe altered perceptions of time and space. Ferrovitreous was a word that popped up and it made me think of Widener.</p><p>CV: Did you choose that book specifically as a pair for this poem?</p><p>MTF: No, it was pretty random. I regularly check books out of the library, borrowing 50 to 60 books total at any given time. I picked up this book and another by Schivelbusch<strong>.</strong> I decided I wouldn’t have time to read them fully—just time enough to pick them up and skim. In the future, I might go back to that particular list of words and write another poem from it. The seeds of this poem were particular words that came from this particular book, but I chose it because I had to return it to the library.</p><p>CV: An element of this poem that generated a lot of discussion on the board was the really exuberant language. It’s almost bombastic. What made you decide to write in that register; was it was because those were the words you were coming across?</p><p>MTF: I think, partially, it was because these particular words were chosen as the seed material for the poem. They seemed to fit together in my mind. I think also there was something about the rabbit and the ear that made me conscious of sound and to prefer the longer lines and longer words. More exuberant, multisyllabic types of words. But my writing is still pretty fluid poem to poem. At the time, I’d been reading some of A.R. Ammons and had read Denis Johnson—both are completely different from this. Very sparse. If anything it’s likely a reaction to what I had been reading recently, what I had wanted to be different from.</p><p>CV: Speaking of language, language—both of the rabbit and the human—is both entrapping and liberating in this poem. That was something that I was trying to work through. Could you talk about that?</p><p>MTF: I think anybody who becomes interested in language comes across the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which I think has been shown to be incorrect by Chomsky and his universal grammar. But the idea is that the language you speak constrains what you can say and therefore constrains what you can conceive of. For example, a language lacking tenses found in other languages, might lend a speaker a different perception of time. And again it becomes absurd to say people can’t conceive of the future because there’s really no functional future tense. It’s always interested me, the idea that what you know how to say in some way constrains what you can say. Poetry sets these constraints on what you’re going to write. Yet, you continue trying to make it interesting, to make it new. I think there’s a natural tendency, then, for poems to address this issue. And there’s isolation in the poem, which ties into that—the fact that language is essentially what enables us to have community, connection, understanding, empathy. But the lack of it, the misuse of it, or the inability to use it can leave you on the outside. That relates to the interaction between a human being and a rabbit because we have no way to communicate with each other. I have no way of knowing what they think of when they hear human speech or hear human footsteps. Just as, I’m sure, they might have squeaks in registers of sound that we can’t even hear. That’s been found with elephants: that they can talk to each other over miles in very low frequency tones that without recording equipment and manipulation just are inaudible to us.</p><p>CV: Right, I got a strong sense of social anxiety, or anxiety about interacting with the rabbit and, once you’re the rabbit, with other rabbits in this poem, which is really interesting considering how confident the tone is in being able to communicate to this audience.</p><p>MTF: I think that’s definitely true: that social anxiety can obscure inward confidence just as outward confidence can obscure an inward anxiety. That’s something that I’ve come to terms with in different ways. On campus, there’s been a lot of talk about mental health and suicide; in an earlier form, the poem did reference that more strongly. Having experienced anxiety, social anxiety and generalized anxiety, I felt it was important to bring such experience into the poem.</p><p>CV: Another question about imagery that I have is on scale, which is out of control in this poem, and I mean that in the best way. In the same two lines we have the Andromeda galaxy and the amount of snow being kicked up by a rabbit. We have a warren and the entire universe. Was your mind flying between images and galaxies while writing this? What made you play with the scale so much?</p><p>MTF: Playing with scale definitely begins with becoming the rabbit, because there’s this transition from the human scale to the rabbit scale. It continues up to this image of snow being kicked up into the air and resembling a galaxy of stars. Each flake being a star or a series of stars close together. I forget where Andromeda came from, but one of my classes this semester is in astronomy. We’ve talked a lot about galaxies and stars. The mythological root behind Andromeda, a princess to be sacrificed, but who also waits to be saved—that’s also where it comes from. The fact that a star would be frightened is a strange thought to have.</p><p>CV: I also wanted to ask you about the ending: “I accelerate out of lens focus/ beyond the pointillistic boundary.” There’s some movement beyond this minute scale, beyond the ability to even perceive things. What’s going on there?</p><p>MTF: The ending now is very different from the original ending. The original ending was much more slapstick. It was essentially being hit on the head by a tree branch while chasing the rabbit. I figured the movement the poem needed was expansion outward into someplace different. Part of my thinking was about the scale, about how small an atom is, how small its parts are. I think it can be read two ways almost: becoming so large that the lens—eyesight or vision—goes out of focus as things become so large they’re just dot-like. And also to become small, to go into the infinitesimal space. I had recently finished watching a documentary about film history, and a particular reference comes from Ingmar Bergman’s <em>Persona</em>, the scene when the filmstrip literally starts to melt. A psychedelic mental breakdown portrayed on screen. That’s part of what inspired those particular lines. The reader identifies with the speaker, has to pick up all of the momentum, and really just vanish.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
