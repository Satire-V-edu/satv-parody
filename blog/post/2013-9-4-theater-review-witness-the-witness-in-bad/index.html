        <p><p><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;"><a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/hagen-bad-news.jpg"><img alt="hagen.Bad News!" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1155" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/hagen-bad-news.jpg?w=670"/></a></span></p><p>“I was there!” the actors cry and cry again in “Bad News!”, a new theater piece directed by JoAnne Akalaitis and composed with Kate Attwell and Greg Taubman. “And you were not,” the actors imply as they stare at the audience sitting in rows of metal folding chairs. The Greek tragedies, from “Antigone” to “The Bacchae,” shed as much blood as the goriest video game, but Greek religion reserved public killing for religious sacrifices, and convention reserved onstage hitting for the comedies. Violence in the tragedies follows a law of controlled blindness: the audience can see the suicidal leap, but the fall must crash out of sight. Messenger speeches, long and breathless reports from the invisible offstage world, serve to fill in the blind spots. “Bad News!”, a staged reading co-presented in July by Poets House and River to River Festival, strings together the messenger speeches from a dozen Greek tragedies (and a few Roman, Renaissance, and contemporary takes on Greek tales). “Bad News!” explores the messenger speech as a dramatic tactic. In the process, it illuminates the figure of the messenger and explores the fraught and complex nature of bearing witness.</p><p>Seven remarkable performers — actors Bill Camp, Karen Kandel, Joan MacIntosh, Elizabeth Marvel, Efthalia Papacosta and Rocco Sisto, and singer Nora York — all play the part of Messenger. They sit on the rough stone steps that edge the Poets House courtyard, an improbable garden squeezed between apartment buildings in downtown New York and here made into a makeshift performance space. They wear everyday clothes; only the scripts in their laps distinguish the performers from the audience. The sky eases toward night, the audience falls hush, and then the performers, shot through with sudden urgency, scramble to their feet and speak.</p><p><span id="more-1154"></span></p><p>Akalaitis, Attwell, and Taubman have<i> </i>excavated fourteen plays for their messenger speeches and lined up the monologues one after another. The process makes for ninety minutes of epiphany, the performers in an absurdly constant state of emergency. By the third or fourth urgent message, calamity, now routine, fails to shock.  And so focus shifts to the messenger — usually a nobody, a nameless witness who appears for one scene, describes someone else’s tragedy, and then submerges once more into the anonymity of the Chorus.</p><p>In a traditional Greek tragedy, the messenger’s moment of prominence is a public act of self-erasure, for the messenger’s bad news overshadows his or her own presence onstage. “Bad News!” traces the figure in the erasure marks. Akalaitis has arranged the messenger speeches like an orchestral score, and the monologues follow an aural logic rather than a narrative arc. The performers begin in unison, the unfamiliar sound of choral speech suggesting the cadences of young children learning lessons. Then one actor, desperate to deliver his news, breaks into a monologue. Another actor interrupts to give her message, and then another cuts in. The performers assume and discard accents and mannerisms, and at times shift into Greek, or song, or back into unison. The surfeit of interpretations makes the messenger an Everyman even as the layered voices make up a hymn to the Messenger.</p><p>Akalaitis defies recent trends toward immersive theater, 3-D movies, and onstage worlds that overflow into the audience and transform the spectators into actors. No missiles shriek toward the seats, and no blood-caked actors drag audience members onstage. “Bad News!” makes the audience witness to the event, or rather, to its telling. The audience to a Greek tragedy peers at the play’s action through the lens of the messenger speeches; the audience to “Bad News!” ignores the distant tragedy to examine the scratched and warped lens itself. The medium is the message, and in this case, the medium is human.</p><p>Of course, “Bad News!” is plain in part because it is a staged reading. But its simplicity makes the courtyard’s edge the threshold between the audience and an unseen world where anything can happen. “I was there,” the performers cry, and run onstage with messages like souvenirs from that invisible other world, <i>there, </i>where a war rages between brothers, where Jocasta learns that Oedipus is both her husband and her son, where<i> </i>a band of wild women scratch the earth and draw up milk and wine.</p><p>A glitzy staging might milk the messenger speeches for spectacle. “Bad News!” takes a gamble and foregoes visceral gut-punch, shushing the Greek tragedies’ kings, gods, and warriors in order to ask why the messengers speak. The messengers admit that delivering the bad news means reliving the painful past and risking the listeners’ anger, and yet their long monologues overflow with awful detail.</p><p>Is this hysteria? Talk therapy two thousand years before Freud?</p><p>A messenger ran from the Marathon battlefield home to Athens, cried out the news of victory, and collapsed. So the marathon was born, and so the messenger died, a story I never understood until this summer. It wouldn’t have hurt anyone if the messenger had taken a breather; it seemed to me that the messenger ran himself to death for no reason.</p><p>Now, months after the bombing at the Boston marathon endangered my friends and paralyzed my city, I still find myself talking about that day. “I was there,” I hear myself repeat. I can guess why the messengers from the story and from the plays risk everything to deliver their messages. It isn’t a sign of hysteria or a cry for attention; it is a witness’s response to tragedy. The telling transforms the messengers from helpless spectators to storytellers. It lets them salvage control from their helplessness. By reliving what should never have happened, the messengers drag the tragedy from the offstage world of possibility to the onstage world of consequence. They speak to realize what they have seen. In the process, they share the burden of witness with all the audience. “I was there,” the actors say, and now you were, too.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
