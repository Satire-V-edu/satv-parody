And the Wade-Thompson Drill Hall, as its name suggests, served as a training ground for American soldiers. When I went to see Ann Hamilton’s <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/arts/design/ann-hamilton-at-the-park-avenue-armory.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Event of a Thread</a></i>, however, the space was devoid of its disciplined phantoms. Occupied by swings, pigeons, Ralph Waldo Emerson, white fabric, caped poets, caped readers, and caped bird-releasers, the drill-hall became at once amusement park and monastery.</p><p>Upon entering the space, I came across two seated persons, their fur-draped backs facing me. They were reading into microphones from manuscripts (of selected lines from Emerson’s essays) that draped off the table, folding upon themselves in wordy ribbons. I imitated a neighbor and held to my ear, like a conch-shell, one of the brown paper bags sitting on the table, to find that it contained a radio transmitting the voice of one of the caped readers.</p><p><span id="more-475"></span></p><p>Past the readers and ribboning words began the swings, suspended from the ceiling by chains on both sides of a white curtain. Ropes attached to both the chains and the curtain ran through a pulley system, making the white swath swing. The curtain was twice as wide as the hall, so it, like Emerson’s prose, gathered and folded upon itself—its ribbons not grounded but suspended and restless, responsive to the comings and goings of the swings on either side. As Hamilton elegantly puts it, “the shifting weather of the white cloth is generated through collective action.”</p><p>While the weather of the lofty silk was socially generated, that of the swing was individually so. The path of each swing, illuminated on the floor by a strip of light, was private, to be tread by no one but the current sitters (I say this in warning, having been rear-ended by a particularly vigorous swinger). My paper bag spoke: <i>cause and effect are two sides of one fact.</i> Here, private moments culminated in a shared woven commotion. Private motion caused public stir; the two co-existed in un-contentious reciprocity.</p><p>On the end of the hall opposite the readers sat the monk-like poet, who toiled away at his verse, apart from the commotion. We were witnesses to his solipsistic moment. The poet’s privacy inspired others to seek the same; several visitors retreated into the shadows by the walls. One stared into the pages of Joyce’s <i>Dubliners</i>. Some climbed to the balcony, apparently heeding their paper bags: <i>the field cannot be seen from within the field</i>, says Emerson.</p><p>While wholly unique, “Event of a Thread” reminded me of two similarly space-transformative installations— one that created a domestic space; the other, a social space. In the show last year at Bard College’s <a href="http://www.bard.edu/ccs/exhibitions/" target="_blank">Hessel Museum</a> entitled “<a href="http://www.bard.edu/ccs/exhibitions/if-you-lived-here-youd-be-home-by-now/" target="_blank">If you lived here, you’d be home by now</a>,” Josiah McElheny displayed his own artworks along with works from the private collection of Marieluise Hessel in galleries furnished as a living room, bedroom, library, and dining room. McElheny’s co-curator, Lynne Cooke, describes their project in a book she edited in conjunction with the show, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.bard.edu/ccs/read/publications/interiors/" target="_blank">Interiors</a></span>. She explains that they sought to invite visitors to engage with the work personally, comfortably, at their leisure; to linger and incorporate the surrounding art as a backdrop to “conversations, musings, and distracted mental driftings.” Their ambition was to provoke a private, internal experience.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, the German artist <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/08/06/120806fa_fact_collins" target="_blank">Tino Sehgal</a> specializes in performance-based, participatory installations that engage the spectator. An exhibit at the <a href="http://www.mariangoodman.com/" target="_blank">Marian Goodman Gallery</a> in 2007 called “<a href="http://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/2007-11-30_tino-sehgal/" target="_blank">This Situation</a>” featured several performers having a philosophical discussion. My family and I, visitors to the show, were encouraged, implicitly and sometimes directly, to join in. The significance of this piece was its social, rather than private, implications for the visitor; it traded solipsism for community (and perhaps some shyness and discomfort.)</p><p>McElheny, Sehgal, and Hamilton all share an aspiration to free art from the purview of the ascetic, numb-footed museum-goer. McElheny invites viewers to adopt his installation as the backdrop to an internal narrative; Sehgal, on the other hand, forces his viewer into a social space. In “Event of a Thread,” Hamilton encouraged the visitor both to retreat within and to engage without. While the transformed drill hall resemblesd no domestic space, the installation, like McElheny’s curation, invited an interiorized experience. The reader of Joyce and swinging couple can attest to this. And while the installation’s readers and poet remained occupied at their own tables, unresponsive to the rare visitor’s attempt to engage them, they, like Sehgal’s philosophizing performers, socialized the space. The very mechanics of the pulley-drawn curtain made physically manifest this private-public interplay. Hamilton puts it best: “If on a swing, we are alone, we are together in a field. This condition of the social is the event of a thread. Our crossings with its motions, sounds, and textures is its weaving; is a social act.”</p><p>In addition to the private-public exchange, the object of the swing contributed to another binary whose fine line “Event of a Thread” elegantly treaded: serious and playful. In transforming a seat into a vehicle of fun, and then inviting her visitors to enjoy it, Hamilton played seriously with notions of art-viewing. Diana Fuss and Joel Sanders, in “<a href="http://www.bard.edu/ccs/read/publications/interiors/" target="_blank">An Aesthetic Headache: Notes from the Museum Bench</a>,” describe the museum bench as a symbol of man’s unavoidable embodiment, that which enables him to surrender rather than attend to the artwork before him. In “Event of a Thread,” Hamilton attached the bench to chains and mobilized it into action. She embraced her visitor’s embodiment and desire to surrender, but the playful seat she provided compelled him, instead, to move and engage with her art.</p><p>Hamilton maintained her installation’s artistic integrity while allowing her visitors to seriously play within it. Fuss and Sanders describe in the same essay the public’s initial fear that a bench, when located within the museum (newly developing as a private institution), would encourage the behavior that it did in a public park: “flirting, playing…talking, laughing, and napping.” And if the park bench elicits this association, much more so does the park swing. Part of the magic of “Event of a Thread” was its capacity to permit such associations (the swings saw a fair share of all of the above-mentioned behaviors) while remaining artful and meditative. Hamilton succeeded in creating a world in which we could be both serious and playful, both alone and in good company.</p><p><em>Picture courtesy of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2012/12/07/arts/design/20121207-HAMILTON-2.html" target="_blank">Philip Greenberg for The New York Times</a></em></p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
