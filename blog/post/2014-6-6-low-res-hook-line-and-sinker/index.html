Maps that we used to rely on before we had iPhones, old faded copies of <em>National Geographic </em>and <em>Cooking Light</em>, and a couple of packs of gum that had long lost their crisp shape, were all crammed into the pocket behind the driver’s seat. Squeezed behind these obsolete artifacts was a book, lovingly crumpled from a combination of wear, and, later, of neglect.</p><p><em>882 ½ Answers to Your Questions About the Titanic</em> sustained me through most car rides, long and short, throughout early elementary school. Each section in the book was short and manageable, introducing me to facts about the steerage, and the bow and the stern every time I turned the page. Some passengers brought their dogs on board.  The kitchens were equipped with twenty-five cases of olive oil, and the three hundred cases of shelled walnuts.  Supposedly, thirteen couples traveling were on their honeymoons. Some scholars speculate it would have been safer to hit the iceberg straight on.  All eight members of the ship orchestra lost their lives. I learned that April 15—tax day—was the day the Titanic sank. Engrossed, I didn’t mind the mild nausea I felt as I read in the backseat.</p><p><span id="more-1428"></span></p><p>While this was one of the few books on the <em>Titanic</em> that I actually owned, the Nautical shelf at the local library replaced ‘Children’s Books’ as my destination of choice. I did own, though, a model of the <em>Titanic</em> that could be submerged in water. When enough water filled the plastic interior, I watched with wide eyes as it would split and then sink. Afterwards, I would let the water drain, and put it back together, for next time.</p><p>Before long, I was rattling off facts about the <em>Lusitania</em>, the passenger ship that was hit by a German U-boat during World War I. On the playground, waiting in line for four-square, I explained to my friends what torpedoes were. Before turning off the light each night, I pored over pictures and skimmed captions about the <em>Andrea Doria</em>, the boat that sank in the 1950s, after colliding with another cruise liner. I still remember thinking how peculiar it was that this ship didn’t sink as dramatically as the Titanic did with its stern sticking up into the night sky. Instead, it sank “horizontally,” rolling over into the depths of the sea.</p><p>2012 marked the hundred-year anniversary of the famous ship’s sinking, which gave those fascinated by the Titanic reason to celebrate.The eponymous movie was also re-released, this time in 3-D, and the love story between Jack and Rose captivated another generation of young adults.</p><p>In theaters, the story, loss, and romance eclipsed the number of workers that built the ship in Belfast, or the fact that the hull of the Titanic of eight hundred and eighty-two and a half feet long, or that only 214 of the <em>Titanic’s</em> 899 crew members survived. The film created its own spectacle, separate from the ship’s historic hype and subsequent tragic voyage. Its fourteen Oscar nominations and haul of eleven of Academy Awards, and budget of $200 million, its star-studded cast of DiCaprio and Winslet shined the brightest. Apparently besides directing, James Cameron himself actually drew all of Jack Dawson’s sketches. The filming largely took place in Baja California, Mexico. The film became the first ever to gross over $1 billion. Triumphant cries of “I’m king of the world,” resounded around the world.</p><p>In the ensuing flurry of media coverage, it became clear that many had failed to realize the connection between the re-release and the anniversary. In candid public tweets, thousands admitted to not realizing that the <em>Titanic</em> was a ship that actually sailed and sank. For them, the <em>Titanic</em> simply was a high-grossing romantic movie and the inspiration for an iconic two-person pose.</p><p>If one casts the right actors and actresses, a fantasy and story will serve as a popular placeholder. The facts on which Hollywood’s unabashed adaptation was based had sunk out of sight, as the real-life tragedy continued to sit solemnly on the ocean floor.</p><p>But the historical event had its own set of facts and figures, in which I took comfort as a child. My favorite book, aptly titled <em>882 ½ <strong>Answers</strong> to Your Questions About the Titanic</em>, seemed to play into this frenzy of information the most. Regardless of how many questions the young reader had, the book always had more answers. The rolodex of information never stopped turning. When we ate dinner, I would remind everyone around the table how much butter was on board the Titanic. I started precociously referring to inanimate objects as “she” or “her.”</p><p>Like the amount of butter, or the maximum speed of these cruise liners, I also could recall with perfect clarity the number of those who perished at sea. These figures became no more than trivia. As an eight year old with soft, flushed cheeks and slipped-on Merrells, I could rattle off the estimated range of those who froze to death, of those who died from complications related to the impact itself. I delivered these facts with a proud smirk.</p><p>As with most obsessions that swell, my fascination and fervor soon waned. I moved on to a new series of phases, diving head first into long division and the gruesome tradition of Roman gladiators fights.</p><p>I still remember that many gladiator helmets were made of bronze.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
