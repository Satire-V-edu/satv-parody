Max joined critic and Harvard professor James Wood to discuss David Foster Wallace in an event co-hosted by the Advocate and the Mahindra Humanities Center earlier this month. See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsbKT50ud04">footage</a> from the evening </i><i>or read a <a href="http://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/wordpress/?p=14135">recap</a> of the event by former Fiction Editor Patrick Lauppe ‘13.</i></p><p>“The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it,” Walt Whitman concluded in his now-treasured preface to the first edition of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. I recalled this conclusion while reading <i>Every Love Story is a Ghost Story, </i>D.T. Max’s new biography of David Foster Wallace. Though Whitman and Wallace seem to occupy distant intervals on the writerly gamut, to me Max’s biography portrayed Wallace as an exemplar of Whitman’s “proof of a poet” statement. Through the biography, the reader absorbs Wallace’s life page by page, and in turn the pages illustrate ways his readers—the nation—slowly soaked into him. Whitman likely did not intend and could not have foreseen such a relationship: Whitman came to epitomize “e pluribus unum” (one from many), while Wallace repurposed our nation’s de facto motto into “e unibus pluram” (many from one).  Wallace aimed to pick up the splinters of the American psyche that had been united, then fractured, in the years since Whitman. The story of how Wallace arrived at his ultimate failure, <i>The Pale King</i>, can be substituted as “the proof of a poet” where the novel itself failed.</p><p>In the preface to <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, Whitman was responding to the paradigms set forth by Ralph Waldo Emerson, in “The Poet,” an essay published eleven years earlier. In that essay Emerson expressed the nation’s need for a visionary who would both articulate and embody the grace and grandeur of America and her people.  But Whitman’s preface was more than a response to Emerson—it was a solution. It served as his statement of intent: to epitomize the qualities Emerson had described, becoming “The Poet” Emerson had so lucidly summoned. A resounding voice of the nation, Whitman met Emerson’s expectations along the way to fulfilling his own. For Whitman, “absorbing” the nation affectionately was a matter of becoming the nation. It is this ethos that engendered “Song of Myself,” which, as the heart of his poetic project, is perhaps the closest we have to an American epic. “I am large, I contain multitudes,” Whitman as narrator declares; “I act as the tongue of you.”</p><p>But this self-as-whole, individual-as-universal notion is only one of many ways to read Whitman’s “proof of the poet” dictum. Throughout Wallace’s biography, D.T. Max allows readers to celebrate Wallace’s life, comprehending the complex writer with newfound affection regardless of whether they have read his work. In turn, the biography describes Wallace’s monumental dedication to his readers, and the ambitious final project undertaken in the name of his readers: the project that ultimately became his demise. These reciprocal processes, though they take place outside the immediate realm of the author’s work, form the mutual “absorption” Whitman’s dictum required.</p><p>The absorption would not be possible if Max had not distinguished the author of <i>The Pale King</i> from the writer who came before, showing how Wallace’s final years were arguably his most insightful. In those years he was more stable than he had ever been, in a functional marriage and in a rewarding teaching position. But the ambition of his final novel loomed large. In his head, his novel was years overdue. In writing <i>The</i> <i>Pale King, </i>Wallace was solidifying answers to all the questions with which he had grappled since the beginning of his career—regarding the novel’s many ambitions, Max writes, “It had to show people a way to insulate themselves from the toxic freneticism of American life. It had to be emotionally engaged and morally sound, and to dramatize boredom without being too entertaining.”</p><p>Emerson contended in “The Poet” that all poetry “was written before time was,” and that in attempting to write, most will miswrite the truth. Wallace, with his colloquial style that newly captured the fragmented experience of late-20<sup>th</sup>-century American life in <i>Infinite Jest</i>, is one of Emerson’s “men of more delicate ear [who] write down these cadences more faithfully, and these transcripts, though imperfect, become the songs of the nations.” But the Wallace who wrote <i>The</i> <i>Pale King</i> was unwilling to concede to imperfection, unwilling to publish the cosmic pulses he intuited until all their points of inflection had been precisely located.</p><p>Although sentences of Whitman’s preface and Emerson’s essay may describe Wallace, Wallace’s image hardly aligns with their transcendentalist visions of the great American bard. But the Wallace of <i>The Pale King </i>ought to. Wallace was characterized by inconsistency—his Midwestern sincerity and straightforwardness seemed at odds with his verbose and elliptical writing style, and yet his motives for <i>The Pale King</i> might reconcile the irregularities. Max hinted at this conflict when detailing the ambitions of <i>The Pale King</i>, noting that the novel “had to sidestep the point that the kind of personality that conferred grace was the opposite of Wallace’s own.” The story of Wallace’s ultimate battle becomes a powerful stand-in for his failed novel’s ambitions, and it shows us the many ways in which his personality, in all its contradictions, is the <i>only</i> kind that might confer grace upon his readers today. Max writes, that <i>The Pale King </i>“was [Wallace’s] effort to show the world what it was to be ‘a fucking human being.’”  Where his final effort foundered, his story might nearly succeed.</p><div>
