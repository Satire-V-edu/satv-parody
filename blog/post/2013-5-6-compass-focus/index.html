I wanted a blue protractor and a green compass but I had to pick one so green it would have to be. Not a lime green and not an olive but some strange middle ground, like an unripe banana or maybe a bay leaf.</p><p>They were on the required supplies list, and though we rarely used them in math class I was always sketching circles on the scrap paper from my mother’s office. I started off shaky, and the hinge on the compass was a little loose, so even when I steadied the arc, my circle’s ends would never line up. I was frustrated.</p><p>But eventually I learned to hold it right, to position my fingers and flick my wrist just so, and I started to experiment. Who needed pencils when I could use pens, or squeeze in a crayon after I shaved its edges with scissors? My circles were good, and they were everywhere.</p><p><span id="more-950"></span></p><p>A few years later, in geometry, I was taught the trick to drawing an ellipse. Put two pins in cork board, tie a string between them — leaving slack — and pull with a pen, tracing around both. It’s because the sum of the distances between a point on the ellipse and its two foci is always constant, they said. It’s magic, I thought.</p><p>This was more fun than the circles. I bought a cork board and did it at home.</p><p>I found that as I brought my foci closer the ellipse would move toward its ideal self, the circle. From the misshapen amorphous thing to perfect radial symmetry. I liked that. I liked how even shapes acknowledged the worth of closeness.</p><p>And as they moved apart it became more and more difficult to draw the ellipse around them, because it was hard to keep the string above the pushpins, and it left me only with a few ugly, unconnected scratches. Once the sum of the distances between the foci equaled the length of the string it was all over — all I had was a point, closer to one focus, maybe, than the other, forgetting what it was to be an ellipse, forgetting how that felt, what it meant. The foci were naked, then. Where were their shells?</p><p>I forgot about the compass. I was getting older, and I forgot about the compass. I’m about to graduate and I’m scared but I forgot about the compass. I can draw the circle without two foci. Less fun, certainly, but I can draw the circle alone.</p><p style="text-align:center;">♠</p><p>It was late and we sat by the water. It was late and it was warm, with a warmth that betrayed its lateness. There were two lampposts, ten feet apart, maybe. I said I wish I had a long rope and a piece of chalk. You said excuse me. I said I’d tie each end to a post and trace an ellipse along the concrete, there, by the water, there, in the warmth. You said it wouldn’t work. I didn’t try.</p><p>There we were, you holding my hand or me holding yours, next to each other but ten feet apart. I couldn’t have known it then but that was the moment we decided not to move closer, the moment we decided to stay an ellipse, flatter even than we had been. Maintaining the flatness would hurt, I thought, but it would hurt less than the sharp explosion of a circle, the puncturing of something real and whole. The ellipse would whimper when it split. The circle would scream.</p><p>We went back inside. I to one room and you to another, and I didn’t come find you, and you didn’t come find me, and we didn’t find each other. We wanted to, probably, but we didn’t try.</p><p>I thought about it, you should know. I did think about it.</p><p><em>Illustration by Sam Richman ’15</em></p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
