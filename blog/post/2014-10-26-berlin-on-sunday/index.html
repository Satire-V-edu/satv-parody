    <article>
        <p><p><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/berlin-on-sunday.jpg"><img alt="berlin on sunday" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1494" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/berlin-on-sunday.jpg?w=670"/></a></p><p>One of Billy Wilder’s earliest films, <em>Menschen am Sonntag, </em>or “People on Sunday,” captures the weekly respite afforded to Berliners after six days of work. Using Wilder’s screenplay, directors Curt and Robert Siodmak send viewers to the Weimar Republic’s laziest days via black-and-white silent images. Intertitles declare that the characters they are about to see—Erwin, a taxi driver; Annie, his wife and a model; Wolfgang, Erwin’s friend and wine seller; Christl the movie extra, and her best friend Brigitte, a record shop girl—are all real Berliners playing themselves. The film was shot only on successive Sundays in 1929 Berlin, so as to allow the “actors” to attend to their regular occupations during filming.</p><p><span id="more-1493"></span>One Saturday, a typically busy day by Zoo Banhof, one of the busiest metro centers in the city, Wolfgang notices an idle Christl waiting for a beau who never arrives. She paces around the train station, searching for the absent boy, out of place in the bustle of commuting Berliners. This is a fact that the filmmakers emphasize by an extreme zoom-out overhead: she is the singular dot that is not moving in a linear fashion to an intended destination. Intrigued, and perhaps a little bored with his own daily demands, Wolfgang invites the stood-up girl to a nearby café. They delight themselves in the midday sun over an ice cream, and Wolfgang invites the girl to the beach the following day: she accepts, shyly. Erwin finishes his work for the week by repairing his taxi, and upon coming home, quarrels with Annie, who has spent the whole day lounging on her chaise. She wants to go to the movies that evening, while Erwin retorts that Greta Garbo will still be showing until the following Tuesday. Out of spite, the couple rips down each other’s wall of celebrity photos: men for Annie, women for Erwin. Wolfgang arrives to remind Erwin of their beach trip, and the men begin to play cards, ignoring Annie. Annie ends her fight by going to sleep. The following morning, the men plan to meet Christl and her best friend, Brigitte, leaving Annie, turned away from the camera on her side, in bed.</p><p>Sunday allows the weekday workers to attend to relationships, to pursue pleasure over monetary pursuits. By law, all shops in Berlin are closed on Sundays.  Although the idea of a day of rest originally comes from the Sabbath in the Bible, in this Weimar film, attending church is not the first thing on the mind for these young Berliners. The commercial aspects of the city shut down because no one intends to pursue consumerist pleasures, allowing employees and employers alike to attend to their personal matters as well. For the “actors,” playing themselves, at play, in this film, is their successive Sunday activity for many weeks; spectators are not quite being offered a documentary, but it’s as close to a fiction-documentary hybrid as you’ll get.</p><p>While our <em>Menschen </em>certainly prefer the shores of Nikolassee  to their weekday responsibilities, the story that unfolds is not always blissful. Jealousy and money troubles manage to permeate the fun. The only character safe from strife is Annie, the model, who leads the purest life of leisure depicted in the film—a life in which she appears to do little to nothing at all.  When the quartet returns back to the Banhof Zoo train station, many train stops, a day, and seemingly a world away from their time on the beach , the girls express their wishes to see the men the following week. While Wolfgang initially agrees to further excursions, Erwin reminds him that they have plans to watch a football game. We never know if the group will reunite again, either on or off camera. The Weimar era was coming to a close, and the filmmakers fled to Hollywood soon after to escape the encroaching clutches of the Nazi Party. Wilder would go on to create comedies, while the Siodmak brothers pursued film noir and science fiction, all safe on the shores of the States.  There was never any cinematic follow-up to the model, the mechanic, or the shop girls. To some extent, they belong to the bright Sundays of one of the brief respite Germany was afforded during the 20th century.</p><p>The four Berliners part ways to prepare for the week ahead. Words and a number flash across the screen: “4 Million People, Waiting For Next Sunday.” Would Sundays taste as sweet without a little bitterness in between bites? For the beach-goers, the Weimar Republic is a Sunday that attempts to heal from the First World War, but has no idea of the bleak weeks to come. After the onset of Nazism, Sunday would not return to Berlin for decades. Today, it is a staple of the city’s culture; an understanding, if you will, that following the hell of a week it only managed to put to bed sixty years after Wilder sent his foursome to the beach, Berlin has earned its days of rest.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
