        <p><p><a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/tools4.jpg"><img alt="tools4" class="aligncenter wp-image-1401" height="495" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/tools4.jpg?w=391&amp;h=495" width="391"></a></p><p><em>In our second installment of pieces exploring </em>The Devil's Advocate<em>‘s spring issue, Jacob Moscona-Skolnik ’16 and poetry editor Colton Valentine ’16 discusses Jacob’s poem, “Ruth Thalia writes to the poet,” which you can find in this recent edition of the magazine. Read the abridged transcript below.</em></p><p><span id="more-1419"></span></p><p>Colton Valentine: I wanted to start by asking you about the title of the poem. We have the speaker, Ruth Thalía, writing to you, the poet, but you’re the one actually writing. Is there some hidden commentary here on the poet and his subject matter or were you just channeling her voice?</p><p>Jacob Moscona Skolnik: This is actually the second poem in the series that I wrote using this voice of Ruth Thalía. She was the first contestant on a new game show in Peru called “The Value of Truth.”The way the show works is you have your person in the hot seat who is asked questions that get increasingly personal. As you answer the questions truthfully, you get more and more money. The objective is to keep answering questions with honest answers to accumulate money. So she’s the first contestant on this show—her family’s sitting right beside her—and she ends up admitting all these things: She has engaged in sexual activity for money; she doesn’t work where she told her parents she was working; she’s not actually in love with her boyfriend who’s sitting right there; she’s waiting for someone better. Long story short, the boyfriend, who’s humiliated on national television, ends up killing her.</p><p>One idea here was to have her writing to me—I’m a complete observer in this situation—to see what would happen if I use her voice and the way I understand all the dynamics at play in her voice. To see what happens when I address myself using that. Because obviously I’m not Peruvian; I’m not Hispanic. I’m adding all my own baggage from my life that’s unrelated to what’s going on. I wanted to make that explicit. I didn’t want to say that I’m going to come here into Peru and pretend to understand what’s going on. I wanted to make that distance really obvious and play with it.</p><p>C: So was this an attempt to get closer to her mind and her voice?</p><p>J: Potentially. It was also to try to figure out the relationship between her voice and my own even though in the poem the two obviously become mixed because I am writing it.</p><p>C: When did you first hear of Ruth Thalía?</p><p>J: I was watching this live. I was in Peru working when the show was starting, and it was huge. Everyone was so excited about this happening, and I was watching this thing with a friend in her house. After the show, there was a first round of publicity about the fact that she had admitted all these things, and then there was a second round of publicity about the fact that she was killed. Everywhere that you walked, you would see the equivalent of gossip magazines with her face on the front. It was bizarre.</p><p>C: One of our board members actually spent part of her last summer in Lima, and she talked about how the poem really captured the sense of the city. What were you doing there?</p><p>J: I was doing a couple things. I was working at a school that was set up near the heart of Lima to provide education for children with a very diverse array of disabilities. There were kids who were blind; there kids who were deaf; there were kids on crutches; there were kids with mental disabilities. A complete range. They were trying to divide them up into classrooms, but really what does that mean? I was doing that, and I was also working for Techo, which is an organization that arranges service projects in areas with high levels or urban poverty. I was frequently traveling out to these “Pueblos Jóvenes,” which are almost shanty towns on the outskirts of Lima. Very poor, urban communities. Part of the imagery comes from those areas, especially the second-to-last stanza, where you have these living structures that go right up to the edge of a highway. They continue back up onto these hills; these almost temporary-living structures just pile on top of each other.</p><p>C: This was last summer?</p><p>J: This was the summer before my freshman year, so two summers ago.</p><p>C: You said you’re not Peruvian, so what attracts you to Lima?</p><p>J: I’ve traveled a lot in South and Central American. The specific attraction to Peru is that my mom had lived there in the early eighties. She was doing medical work there, so I was living with a doctor and his wife that she had worked with thirty-plus years ago. Basically, I went with no particular agenda and ended up getting involved in these various projects and traveling around a little bit.</p><p>C: I love how this poem blends politics and aesthetics. You mention several different radical leftist groups—the FARC, sendero—and then capitalism. But it’s this white sphere. The work is always flitting with taking a political stance, but there’s all this irony and play: Capitalism is a jeopardy answer. What’s going on with all of that?</p><p>J: It’s difficult because when I write poetry my natural instinct is to tackle these big issues, these big problems. And it’s really easy when doing that, when talking about capitalism, to write things that become obvious, that have been written before, that come to not particularly meaningful conclusions, that are trite. What has helped me is taking these big ideas and not pretending that I’m coming to some dramatic conclusion in discussing them. Not saying: Capitalism is wrong, and it’s causing this problem—it has manipulated this woman through this game show and resulted in her death. To 1) not pretend I’m doing something huge with these things and 2) to make them really concrete. Which is kind of what I’m doing with capitalism—saying that it’s a sphere makes it easier to talk about. Once it’s something concrete, you can talk about that concrete thing. How does it feel? What does it look like? What’s going on? And allow that to give character to something like capitalism without explaining capitalism itself.</p><p>C: You mentioned wanting to shy away from a sort of conclusion or resolution on capitalism. The end, to me, seems to gesture toward some kind of resolution, but it is also is playing with perspective. Things were seen sideways in the past but now from above and below. Do you want it to strike as more dissonant or resolved?</p><p>J: I’m not really sure. I don’t think it really can be resolved in a satisfying way, in the same way that when someone dies in the way that Ruth Thalía dies—as a result of this game show—you can try to explain it. You can try to make sense of what’s going on. But you’re never going to really feel that you’ve come to a satisfying conclusion. I think it can go either way, but I definitely would not want someone to come away from this poem feeling like they found an answer or that it has come to a conclusion.</p><p>C: The sort of obvious addressee in this poem, from the title, is the poet. But I also felt like at certain times the “you”bordered on being the man who had killed her. Is that something that you were thinking about?</p><p>J: Interesting. I wasn’t thinking about that. The first poem in this series was her addressing the boyfriend, the guy who killed her. Potentially my writing that first poem had a trickle effect into this one.</p><p>C: How many poems are in the series?</p><p>J: So far, three, of which this is the second.</p><p>C: Is this something that you’re going to keep working on? Or do you feel like it’s a triplicate and that’s it?</p><p>J: I didn’t initially intend for it to be a series. I wrote the first one, and then Joshua Bell—I wrote this in his poetry class—suggested that I work with it. I wrote the second one because I found a new perspective that I thought would work. I don’t want to say that I will or I won’t. If I think of something that could benefit from using this voice, then I will.</p><p>C: Series are such an interesting idea in poetry because each poem has to stand on its own—and this one is being published by itself—but then they’re also working toward something larger. How do you see this as fitting into the larger project? Do you think it needs to do that? Or do they just treat a similar subject?</p><p>J: I think it can definitely stand alone. The images that are in this poem don’t need to follow from anything else. The poems are sort of additive; they just paint a more complete picture, but they can exist by themselves.</p><p>C: This poem has a very unusual form and physical appearance on the page. Some lines are indented; some groups of words are separated by extra spaces within a single line. Is there an intention behind that or did you just like how it looked?</p><p>J: I wanted to remove any formal structure: periods, commas, obvious line breaks, things like that. In part because the speaker isn’t really a person; she’s this dead voice that’s speaking from somewhere that’s not obvious or explained. Then I thought, how can I direct the way I want this to be read—the speed, the flow of the lines—in a way that someone would know what to do and how to read it without any punctuation. I came to this form in which the idea was to use space that would force a reader to subconsciously read it at a certain speed. Taking time at certain places. Putting emphasis on certain words. I just started writing it that way, and it really became easy to think of not lines or sentences in the traditional sense, but words and spaces as a way of directing the flow of the poem. It definitely doesn’t mimic him, but part of the inspiration for that came from Mayakovsky, who was a Russian poet before and after the Russian Revolution. What he did is—it’s hard to explain without seeing it graphically—but he used small line breaks and spaces to allow the display of the poem on the page to mimic speech patterns. Using actual spacing of words and lines to influence the way that the speed and flow works.</p><p>C: Right, instead of syntax, which is what you would normally use. Do you have any other main inspirations—not necessarily for this poem—but in general?</p><p>J: I have read a lot of early and mid-twentieth century Russian writers in translation. Another main influence is Lorca, who I’ve read in Spanish. Everybody loves Lorca so it feels weird to say Lorca, but he’s an inspiration for how I understand images to be most successful in poetry.</p><p>C: I thought about Lorca when I was reading this. Do you have a favorite poem by him?</p><p>J: Canción de Jinete is great. Romance Sonámbulo is another great one; it was also turned into a song. La Muerte is a lesser known one, but it’s kind of bizarre.</p><p>C: Is there anything else you want to say about this poem or yourself as the poet or Ruth Thalía? Or capitalism?</p><p>J: I guess this poem was in part my attempt to tackle these really big questions that I think everybody thinks about. But to try to do it in a way where you’re not coming to a big conclusion and you’re not pretending to do something that you’re not. But you just put these things out there, add imagery to it, and see what happens. See the emotions that can be evoked.</p><p class="wpa wpmrec">
