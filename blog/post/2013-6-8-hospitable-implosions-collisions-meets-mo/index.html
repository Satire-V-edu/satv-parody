Image courtesy of whitney.org</em></p><p>In the spring issue of <i>The Devil's Advocate</i> are two features, <a href="http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/motel" target="_blank">“Motel” by Georgina Parfitt</a> and <a href="http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/collisions" target="_blank">“Collisions” by My Ngoc Toc</a>, whose titular pairing is irresistible. What kinds of collisions spawn a motel? Destroy one? What kinds of collisions occur daily within?</p><p>Parfitt describes three days spent in and around a buttery-yellow Rest Inn Motel; Toc riffs on the event of collision, which she approaches, avoids, and actualizes in a variety of contexts. Reading the two features in tandem brought me to mind of a contemporary phenomenon and an artistic representation thereof: the implosion of old hotels to make way for new (prevalent, until recently, in Las Vegas), and Richard Artschwager’s <i>Destruction</i> series, which depicts the implosion of the Traymor Hotel. The collision in question is bipartite: the violent meeting of future and past, and the deathly embrace of dynamite and architecture.</p><p><span id="more-970"></span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Historical Hotels</i></p><p>Under the National Trust for Historical Preservation, <i>Historical Hotels of America</i> recognizes and advertises hotels throughout the country for their commitment to preserving the past. Their members make claims to having housed the likes of Katherine Hepburn, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and combatants in the Civil War. The Beekman Arms and Delamater Inn of Rhinebeck, New York, prides itself on being the oldest hotel in America, allegedly founded in the early 1700s by William Traphagen, when the town was known by its Dutch inhabitants as “Ryn Beck.” It is rumored that George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and Benedict Arnold slept, drank, and waxed revolutionary there. A Rhinebeck native, I proudly echo the Beekman’s insistence on superlatively historical roots, and some cursory research has assured me that, while other hotels do make claims to the same (as I feared), th’ol Beekman always falls somewhere in the ranks of oldest. To preserve landmark hotels is to sustain the memories made under their roofs. Someone important, we convince ourselves, breathed this air, tread these floorboards, grazed these walls with blessed sleeves. By inhabiting their old haunts, we grow nearer to our dead icons; we share a place in common. Unlike the physical luxuries of hot tubs and plush beds, which coax us into expensive solipsism, knowledge of a hotel’s history breaks down its walls, extending present into past and realizing present as the past for a future to come.</p><p>Yet not all hotels share this drive to preserve.</p><p><i>Enter collision number one:</i> <b>Future meets past.</b></p><p><i>And collision number two</i>:<b> Dynamite meets architecture.</b></p><p>As Toc puts it: “one object travels at such feverish high speed, and is so much more massive, that it will devour the other.”</p><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Dunes’ Doom</i></p><p>In contrast to the <i>Historical Hotels of America</i>, there exists another philosophy of success in the hospitality industry: one that erases the past and looks to the future, erodes the old and flaunts the new.</p><p>Equipped with the slogan “The Miracle in the Desert” and an Arabian Nights aesthetic, the Dunes hotel in Las Vegas thrived for forty years before its life-span was cut short by antsy profiteers. Built in 1955, the hotel saw many an acclaimed entertainer loiter in its lobby, among them Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, and the Minsky’s Follies. By the 90s, however, its revenue had fallen as it couldn’t compete with the shinier resorts that had sprung up since its midcentury heyday. In October, 1992, it was purchased by Steve Wynn. In 1993, the Dunes hotel, Miracle in the Desert, was imploded by six hundred pounds of dynamite. Or rather, “exploded” by a pirate ship from Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, as the spectacle was staged to appear. The 1.6 billion dollar Bellagio resort sprung upward from its ashes.</p><p>In the fifteen years following the demise of the Dunes, twelve other Vegas hotels were demolished in like fashion—the cycle of implosion and construction a regenerative process perfectly suited for a city allergic to decay (might I say <a href="http://theadvocateblog.net/2013/04/05/symposium-boredom/" target="_blank">boredom</a>) and addicted to marvel. The old made room for the new. From dust to dust, or something like that.</p><p>Most implosions attracted large audiences, and that of the Landmark resort was made explicitly cinematic by its appearance in the film <i>Mars Attacks!.</i> While I would expect as much from spectacle-hungry Vegas-goers, I, personally, would find it hard to abstract the wonder of a collapsing building from events that have attached themselves to images of the same. In my opinion, the demolition of the Desert Inn’s Augusta Tower, for instance, is too reminiscent of that of the Twin Towers to engender applause. In the midst of violence and intentional destruction, I think the least we can do is preserve what we have.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><i>A Celotex Conclusion</i></p><p>I’d like to conclude with what got me started: a tableau entitled<i> Destruction IV</i>, which was on display at Artschwager’s Whitney retrospective last summer.<i> </i>Painted with acrylic on the characteristically Artschwagerian Celotex, it depicts the demolition of Atlantic City’s Traymore Hotel in 1972, carried out despite campaigns for its preservation. Mediated first by a newspaper photograph, and then by the fibrous Celotex, the painting both distances and slows the explosion. In grainy black and white, the crumbling demands not cheers but meditation. We are forced to pause and knit together shades of grey to realize its totality.</p><p><i>Destruction IV</i> preserves the past by recording its destruction for the future to witness. It slows down our “feverish high speed” by demanding stillness and careful observation. It de-glorifies demolition by presenting it unexplained, leaving for the viewer all the associations that the explosion is apt to provoke.</p><p>The painting is rendered even more powerful by what directly followed its display: Artschwager passed away just a week after the closing of the show that commemorated his life’s work. Unbeknownst to the Whitney, it, like Artschwager, was recording a life on the precipice of death.</p><p>Parfitt’s feature goes some way in painting an alternative to destruction’s false sense of regeneration: allowing the future to stretch out before us, and the past to be revisited. As she describes, “The sun enters in ribbons. I fall back asleep. The day stretches out in front of me.” Then, as she stands at the train station, considering leaving, she muses, “Any of these places are places I could go. Instead, I turn back, away from the platform, in the direction of The Rest Inn Motel.”</p><p>Supposedly since 2007 Vegas has turned to renovation as a means of remedying stasis. Perhaps the destructive trend truly has seen its end, and we’re finally catching up to the past.</p><p> </p><p><i>Reach The Harvard Advocate’s Spring Issue <a href="http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/category/archive/spring-2013" target="_blank">here.</a></i></p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
