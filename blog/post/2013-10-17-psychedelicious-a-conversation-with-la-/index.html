    <article>
        <p><p style="text-align:center;"><iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="442" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1889112855/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/notracklist=true/" style="position: relative; display: block; width: 350px; height: 442px;" width="350"></iframe></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Earlier this semester, I had the pleasure of interviewing Nico Schwalbe, guitarist and lead singer of the band L.A. Jeff. We met at Café Gato Rojo to discuss psychedelia, Harvardiana, and miscellanea. The following is a transcription of the parts of our conversation I deemed blog-appropriate. You can hear L.A. Jeff live this Saturday, October 19, 9 pm, at 21 South Street.</em> – <em>Kevin Hong ’15</em></p><p><span id="more-1208"></span></p><p>Kevin Hong: Where are you guys from?</p><p>Nico Schwalbe: I was actually born in L.A., but I grew up in France. Parker is from here, Will is from NorCal, Sam is from England and Saman is from New York, but his family is from Iran. So we’re really from all over the place, which is somewhat unusual since bands so often form in these local microcosms.</p><p>KH: What was your previous band name?</p><p>NS: Lunar Volk, which is the name of our EP now. It was all recorded and engineered at the SOCH studio. Dan Thorn, who graduated in ’11, engineered and mixed everything except “To Good to Be True,” which was mixed by Strange Majik in NYC. I really want to give Dan and his band, The Dying Falls, a shout out for all the support they’re giving us!</p><p>KH: You played a bossa nova cover at your last show; I’m curious about how bossa nova fits into your style.</p><p>NS: Well that’s interesting. I’ve always had a connection to Brazil and Brazilian music because my family lived there for four years. My mom and my aunt, who passed away last year, were always listening to it. For me it’s always been there. In a lot of ways the format is jammy and there have been bands like Os Mutantes …</p><p>KH: The Mutants?</p><p>NS: Yeah! They were kind of one of the first psychedelic bossa nova bands in the sixties. They added the fuzz pedal to bossa nova, so there’s definitely a bridge between psych and bossa nova. Psychedelic music is supposed to “transcend” national boundaries: there’s Indian psych, psych folk, psych blues … It goes on and on.</p><p>KH: How about psychedelicious?</p><p>NS: Psychedelicious! I guess it’s psychedelicious because it’s supposed to stimulate your imagination in a pleasurable way.</p><p>KH: For the brain buds?</p><p>NS: Yeah, tasty for your brain buds.</p><p><em>(Laughter)</em></p><p>KH: Would you say Os Mutantes are one of your main influences?</p><p>NS: No, I wouldn’t say that because Saman and I are the ones who are really into that kind of music. Ultimately we all converge on sixties garage rock, which is such a huge mine of music. There were so many tiny bands back then: one guy would get a guitar for Christmas and the other guy a drum set and start a band, write these two minute songs. In terms of more recent psychedelia, I’ve been personally very influenced by the Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is essentially the vision of this one guy, Anton Newcombe, who’s been at it for  a very long time. I guess he kind of embodies the myth of the mad artist … for better or for worse. I also really like Sonic Youth. Sam really loves them, too.</p><p>KH: How would you guys characterize your band? I’m interested in the idea of a psychedelic band like yours being influenced by pretty crazy people, but also by more academic interests.</p><p>NS: I think most of us have a very nerdy, almost encyclopedic approach to music, which is reflective of the academic environment that we’re in. For myself, I’ve spent a lot time doing a lot philosophy stuff so it’s interesting to me to see the connections between theory and practice.</p><p>KH: You’ve also mentioned that you have this dream of pressing vinyl. You stream music, so why vinyl, which seems outdated?</p><p>NS: Yeah. In the world of rock music vinyl is pretty prevalent for releases because it has a more “expansive sound,” whatever that means. I didn’t really use to be into it until I kind of had a revelation where I was like: ”Wow, this really sounds better!” I think it’s a personal preference though. I guess today the real fans get the vinyl, just because it does offer a more complete listening experience; mp3 is so compressed, so you lose a certain sense of space. I don’t really think anyone makes any money selling vinyl though. <em>(Laughter)</em></p><p>KH: You mentioned that the garage punk bands of the sixties wrote very short songs, while yours seem to be longer.</p><p>NS: It’s true; our songs do tend to be more in the four-minute range. I like short, I like long, each one has its virtues. People also played short in the sixties because that’s how much music you could get on one of those cheap seven-inch 45rpm discs!</p><p>KH: I guess they had a different conception of the portable in those days …</p><p>NS: Totally. What’s really cool is a lot of music from that era, like Jamaican rocksteady and Ska, which Saman and I love, was mastered for small crappy radio speakers, so now it sounds great on your phone! Today, though, music is much bassier, which doesn’t sound great on the phone. So, in a sense, it’s less portable!</p><p>KH: That’s really interesting …</p><p>NS: I also think it’s fascinating that it’s really in the sixties that music started to become a mass consumption good, which it still is today, although a large part of that consumption is demonetized and basically free. When you’re paying Spotify, Rdio or Pandora you’re not paying the artist; you’re essentially paying for your access to unlimited free music.</p><p class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1215" style="width: 680px" rel="width: 680px"><a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/l-a-jeff-photo.jpg"><img alt="L.A.

Jeff performing at the Harvard Monday Gallery<br></p><p><br></p><p>KH: Where do you see L.A. Jeff in two or five years?</p><p>NS: Touring, hopefully, making more records, playing disco and funk (one of my personal dreams), and making people dance at our shows!</p><p>KH: <em>(Laughter)</em> Does no one dance at your shows these days?</p><p>NS: Not that much. A little bit?</p><p>KH: Is that a Harvard thing?</p><p>NS: It seems to be more of a US thing. I know that in France, where I’m from, people dance more willingly. A lot of US bands like Crocodiles or the Black Angels say that, too: audiences in Europe dance more, which is why we wanna go there!</p><p>KH: L.A. Jeff’s Euro trip! Do US listeners have more inhibitions?</p><p>NS: US listeners have a more critical outlook, both in the positive and negative sense of that word. They have greater exposure to rock music and it means something different to them than to European audiences. Because there’s less of a history of people being in bands there, people are more into the myth and the mystique of rock music, which is something I’m really fascinated by because rock is a myth in the dual sense of the word: it’s completely fake but it still has important symbolic capital.</p><p>KH: Greil Marcus delves a lot into this idea of the generational myth-making in rock.</p><p>NS: It’s weird, though, because for me rock isn’t really a generational thing. I really started listening to contemporary rock about a year ago. I guess I share more references with older people! I was always way more into The Stones than Radiohead, for example. I’ve been listening to them since I was three, and have been hooked ever since!</p><p>KH: You identify more with the sixties than with contemporary culture?</p><p>NS: Yeah, I guess … That’s part of the of the L.A. Jeff character. He’s stuck in the sixties.</p><p>KH: <em>(Laughter)</em> L.A. Jeff is a character?</p><p>NS: Yeah, totally. He’s a spirit friend that we carry along with us and he’s definitely stuck in the sixties delusion; there’s part of the sixties and of psychedelic culture which is definitely delusional.</p><p>KH: Is the revival of psychedelic rock intentionally delusional?</p><p>NS: Part of it definitely is. There’s this assertion that fantasy triumphs over reality, which is obviously delusional to an extent.</p><p>KH: I’m reminded of Nietzsche’s comment in “On the Use and Abuse of History for Life”; he talks about a culture’s need for an imaginary horizon. So does L.A. Jeff come from this need for imagination?</p><p>NS: Yeah, well, L.A. Jeff was born out of our imaginations one Friday afternoon over margaritas. We were trying to find a new band name, and someone had a tongue slip, and we were awestruck by the spirit that visited us. It just seemed to make sense and got our imaginations stimulated. We realized after the fact that L.A. Jeff may or may not be related to The Big Lebowski, another man stuck in the sixties.</p></p>
