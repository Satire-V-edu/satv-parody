<p>The pink and blue Ferris wheel costs a suggested donation of four dollars. A line forms only when we approach the empty, swirling machine: three pale bodies, SPF 70 insured today, guaranteed to wake up tomorrow with flecks of skin peeling off red noses. To find our faces in the crowd, look for one boy with glasses, and another in a black Ché cap. Next to them you will find me, with rounder glasses and a backward, paisley hat.
</p>
<p>Last night the domed friend hosted a party for his start-up. He’s the intern. In a room of ten 30-something paunchy Indian men, we ate multiple Chipotle build-your-own-burritos while playing Cards Against Humanity. Several cards required explaining to the company CEO. Until 11pm, we were not the only attendees under twenty-one. There were two others, the CEO’s toddler twins, who tumbled around the party, sucking on closed primary-colored beer cans that might one day make a great #tbt.<span id="more-1498"></span>
</p>
<p>With his free hand, the ride operator waves us past the gate into the gondola. His other hand alternates between a few jerky seconds on the control panel, and extended, slow movements of a 24 oz Corona from the pink table to his lips. Under the “Notice to Passengers,” rule #4 states “Persons who are visibly ill or under the influence of drugs or alcohol are not permitted to ride.” Nothing about open containers, so he is free to drink. And nothing about invisibly under the influence of alcohol, either, so we shut the flap that protects us from the ground, and begin the climb.
</p>
<p>Squeaks of the pistons run from the soles of my feet to the raised hairs on my neck. In 6<sup>th</sup> grade, a glass elevator rode me up to the top of the Eiffel Tower with green cheeks. My first memory happens to be a dream of me hugging the moon, then slipping away from its crater-ridden embrace, and falling to Earth. I hate waiting in line for roller coasters. This is my first time in a Ferris wheel, making today a day of many firsts.
</p>
<p>First time swinging above the Earth in a circular path, and first time at a NASCAR race.
</p>
<p>At 7 o’clock on the rotation, the track covered in cars rises from the other side of the hill. 343 out of 350 laps have passed in a dull blur of sound. Earplugs stick out of our ears like Martian antennas; we’re all strangers in a strange land. Across the gondola, separated by a white, rusting pole, our host either takes a picture of my sweating face, or a selfie.
</p>
<p>Behind him a field of crushed wheat stretches into Sonoma Valley, the host county of the race, known for red wine, not necks. In this field, rows of RV’s sprout and rise into tailgates grilling to a crooning Johnny Cash. One event is fenced in with orange, temporary chicken wire. An American flag drapes over the entrance. On the other side of the divide, three men with goatees, aviators, and beers bathe in an above ground pool.
</p>
<p>From this high up, you can’t see them, or the father and son walking by in matching shirt and cargo shorts, but you can imagine dipping into the warm waters for a moment, close to the ground and on the static, but rotating earth.
</p>
<p>90<sup>o</sup> from the start, and still he snaps pictures. I know because I took pictures of him taking pictures. Below, the cars are as small as some of the people watching. The crowd sits in silence; nobody talks, because any sound that leaves your lips stumbles onto the track and disappears in the roar of 200 mph engines.
</p>
<p>Our row, in section 9, is silent like the rest, because no one sits there. We purchased front row seats, advertised as “the fasted on the track!” but also the cheapest in the entire stadium. Closer seats mean more noise means greater likelihood your ears will ring till Tuesday. The fans know this, we didn’t.
</p>
<p>About a 1/8 left to the top, my ankle, finally, stops bobbing up and down faster than the shaking wheel. Intermittent cracks, however, still shut my eyes. Open, and see the line of mobile markets stretching around the rim of the basin. A trailer of official NASCAR merchandise rests without a line next to a deluxe truck dedicated to one driver, Dale Earnhardt Jr. It attracts a clump of men and boys, all in hats with wads of cash tight between their fingers.
</p>
<p>Earlier, I asked a fan who the most popular driver on the circuit is.
</p>
<p>“Dale.”
</p>
<p>“Why?”
</p>
<p>Pause.
</p>
<p>“Because.”
</p>
<p>Another pause, then he adds: “Also Danica.”
</p>
<p>“Why?”
</p>
<p>Pause; I complete their thoughts: “because she’s a…”
</p>
<p>Giggle.
</p>
<p>Dale Earnhardt Jr., son of Sr. (A famous driver who died in the metal grip of his car, after a crash fractured his skull), has won the most popular driver award 11 consecutive times. He has never won a Sprint Cup, NASCAR’s Super Bowl/World Series/Stanley Cup. Jimmie Johnson, 6-time champion, first driver to win AP Male Athlete of the Year (2009), five-time driver of the year, is not on their list, does not have his own merch truck, and few jerseys in the crowd spell out his #48.
</p>
<p>Allegiances in a sport where the “Team” is a white male strapped in polyester advertisements in a metal box, are odd. My roommate, at his first race, is most excited about the Dogecoin car, the #98, sponsored by funds raised on Reddit and painted with the cockeyed doge (so humor) on the rear fender to annoy cars and delight fans. Danica Patrick, as the boys acknowledged, is the lone and first female driver in the big leagues, and walks around in lucrative neon green Go Daddy! Ads, when not stripping for American during Super Bowl commercials.
</p>
<p>Beside the merchandise, drink stands advertise “fresh lemonade” on one side, and “Spiked Lemonade” next door, separated by one word but flowing from the same citrus source. The lunch line for chicken fingers stretches into the lemonade’s turf, lasting 30-45 minutes, depending on how you push. For my lunch, I went next door, sans line, eating a gourmet lamb sausage with fennel slaw. It arrived split down the middle, on a stale hamburger bun. My friends waited for chicken fingers, and received 3 each, at a rate of $3.33 per finger.
</p>
<p>Our gondola slides into the top, jerks to a stop, and we look out from the tallest point in the stadium. Nothing is above our heads, everything sits below, in the cloud of noise and fumes. The track winds in a boot around the basin, .625 miles (1km) per laps. Tag it on Apple Map, and you’re at Infineon Raceway, the official name for the seats watching the cars circle over asphalt, surrounded by stretches of dust. Up here, the distinct features include a Toyota sign, a Toyota Tundra hanging on display (from a crane), and the beige hills rising from the bowl, stretching outward and into green wineries, somewhere in the same county. But no one in attendance faces away from the bowl. Their eyes follow the cars, around and around, completing Δd= 0 as Δt approaches 3 hours, baked at 100 <sup>o </sup>F.
</p>
<p>Between the viewers and the drivers, different barriers circle the track, various heights to correspond to the level of risk in a particular section of the curve. At other races (but not today), some turns will turn on a car, and flip the vehicle at the crowd; when that happens, the fence will catch the projectile before it can land in three rows at once.
</p>
<p>Back where we should be, one of these chest-high fences separates the viewer from the track. It’s the perfect height to lean on. Everyone practices standing here in front of the front row, arms draped over this chain-link protector, in an act that places part of you on the track. One quick shove, and the entire body could cross the barrier, entering a space reserved for cars and the humans inside them. It’s only a 50-yard dash over a sloped dirt stretch to reach the outer limits. Once parched Earth becomes manicured asphalt, the track will burn the soles of your feet, and at any moment, a car could rip the air around your face, pushing hair away from your skin into splayed disarray. One more step, and maybe you could touch the car itself, feel the thrill of 200 mph beneath your fingers, passing by. From the stands, sight can only approach the need for speed, never moving fast enough to catch a ride.
</p>
<p>The time down from the top, I know now, goes by much quicker than the way up. You’ve seen this height before, same angle, just translated a radii or less. When we get back to the bottom and open the gate, the race ends. Someone won, and later, I look up his name. Carl Edwards. The man seated behind us wore his number on his jersey, and on his hat to protect his baldhead, and on his shorts, too. At first we thought he was a scout for Edwards, snooping from the crowd. But then we leaned in closer, picked out pieces of muffled conversation, and learned he was a guest, just like us, plus one giant Aflac duck squawking across his chest.
