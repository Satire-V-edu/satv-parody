After making this recording, Zoë and Kevin Hong had an in-depth discussion about the piece; an abridged transcript of the interview is published here. You can subscribe to The Harvard Advocate <a href="http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/subscribe-0">here</a>. </em></p><p><em>–Moeko Fujii ’15</em></p><p><span id="more-1324"></span></p><p>Kevin Hong: When you write poems, do you imagine them as being delivered with your voice? Or do you imagine other people reading them out loud?</p><p>Zoë Hitzig: My default mode is to think about a poem in my voice. But it’s also really important to have the external experience of just listening, rather than listening and reading, or listening and speaking.That’s why I record.</p><p>KH: You have to experience it as being read, so that you’re making sure that you’re pacing the reader in the way that you want it.</p><p>So more along the lines of voice—I think that in this poem, there are a couple of different modes or voices that’s going on, so can you take us through that a little bit?</p><p>ZH: I wrote this in two voices. Like I’m talking to an evil twin, and the evil twin is talking back. I think that who’s evil and who is not is confused throughout the poem.</p><p>KH: So, in lines like <i>“let go please, shadow sister, watch me swear you one wisdom tooth”—</i> then you have a ship metaphor—is there some sort of exchange going on between the two sides? What is this “Commerce” that’s going on?</p><p>ZH: I see this as a battle and bartering between two sides of the self, or a person and her shadow. Or however you might want to say it—a twin with her evil twin? All those different tropes can be imposed onto it. I liked the idea of thinking of the personal, one-to-one stuff as mapping onto the global world. That’s one of the things that I was thinking about—how the global lines of commerce and economy and shipping and mining and production and all of these big macroeconomic dances are mimicked in interpersonal relationships and persona.</p><p>The idea of a Protected Designation of Origin completely fascinates me—you can only say that your product is ouzo if it comes from a very specific region—what a funny idea.</p><p>KH: Do you want to talk about the form a little bit? I’m interested in these long lines, first of all—these lines that are mimetic, in a way—“<i>as further proof that shadows want flesh to buckle slump, stretch horizontal</i>”—there’s a sort of a drunken feel to some of it, and I would love to hear how you created that.</p><p>ZH: I played around with the form a lot, and the main feeling that I wanted to convey was the feeling of a jolty jaunt. Spiraling down a hill. I also have the wheel imagery that comes out in the end—and the gyroscope. I was thinking of how to get that sense of descending, downward motion, with something cyclic, but also not smooth at all. There are some lines that are perfectly iambic, and some that are tough and tricky to read. I definitely played around with the length of the lines—at first I wrote very short lines, which lent themselves to a faster pace. But that didn’t feel enough like an amble— it felt too out of control.</p><p>KH: Does ouzo factor into the shipping idea? The idea of an intoxicant coming from a distant place?</p><p>ZH: Yeah, there’s a lot of intoxication in this poem. One of the things I was thinking about when I was writing the poem was how bizarre it is that ouzo—and other liquors that typically use anise—look like milk when you put water in them. A glass of ouzo or a glass of absinthe on the table can be mistaken for milk?</p><p>KH: Did you ever write under the influence Zoë?</p><p>ZH: What? (laughter). I don’t think I wrote this poem while I was drinking. It was definitely inspired by intoxication and the relationship that you might have with an intoxicated self.</p><p>I was writing this poem in Greece. Interestingly two of the poems that are published in the TRIAL issue are set in the Aegean Sea.</p><p>KH: Matt Krane’s ‘For the Crew Marooned On an Island in the Aegean Sea’. <i>TRIAL</i> is going to be great.</p><p>ZH: This issue will be <i>great</i>.</p><p><em>Illustration by Michelle Long ’17</em></p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
