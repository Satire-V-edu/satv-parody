    <article>
        <p><p>We went to the theater last week. On a Sunday evening, cold, to see a play my mother had read about in the Tribune and later termed The Show That Had That Scene With The Naked Guy. It had other merits, of course, like an onstage pool of water and literary references, but when we stepped into the elevator with no one else around she looked down, shaking her head: “I just don’t know why he was naked.”</p><p>It was the aggressive sexuality of it all, the nude’s lack of subtlety, that made her so uncomfortable—but there was something else, maybe. He was so transparent up on the stage. There he was, all of him. His heart-shaped birthmark, usually tucked into his trousers like a piece of gum stuck between the leaves of a napkin, breathed free instead under hot lights. She felt, I think, like a voyeur.</p><p><span id="more-446"></span></p><p>“Mom, push the button,” my sister nudged. We were still on the first floor. “Anyway,” my mother went on, “he could have worn a diaper or something. You weren’t naked in your debates, were you?”</p><p>I should probably clarify. I used to do Speech, which my mom calls Debate (my sister does Debate, which my mom calls Speech), and I never was, nor ever felt the need to be, nude. She meant merely to propose that my sixteen-year-old self, neatly wrapped in a black pantsuit, had subtlety—that first thing violated by the actor’s nudity. But did I? When, in high school, I competed in Dramatic Duet Acting, the scenes my partner and I chose were hardly understated: the climax of Edward Albee’s <i>Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf</i> (which opened, if I recall, with “George, get me a drink”), and two years later, the climax of Ryan Craig’s <i>The Glass Room</i>, the story of a Holocaust-denying historian and her Jewish lawyer. We were clothed, to be sure, but our words weren’t shy.</p><p>My scene partner—Frank, hi Frank, if you’re reading this we should get coffee Frank—was a brilliant actor. He was well-trained, but with a natural talent that would manifest itself as a sidelong glance or a particularly apt pronunciation of the word “love.” And I was new: to acting, to the Speech Team. I thought shouting lines made them more powerful and sighing deeply signified <i>intense regret</i>. I was, by all counts, totally unsubtle.</p><p>Synonymous with <i>unsubtle</i> is <i>transparent</i>, both hallmarks of Naked Guy, but the two don’t always travel together. Loud as I was, transparent I was not. And transparency is what I’m really getting at. What good actors do—what Frank did—is suspend me in their silences, keep me affixed to what seems so real in their emotions. When Frank spoke I could have sworn that that was what he felt, that I was seeing to the core of him. Then in a second, with a muttered, “Let’s take it from the top,” it all evaporated.</p><p>This transparency—and it was that, it felt like that!—was not of the fleshy variety that so discomfited my mother. No, this was the illusion of transparency. Frank was playing sad, and when the curtain fell his smile would return. But the actor in that show was not <i>playing</i> nude, he simply was; and so the delicate artifice of the play-world, where all emotions are genuine and poignant for the span of ninety minutes, collapsed.</p><p>This is what is unsettling about the naked body in theater. It is so distinctly non-performative. It speaks to our anxieties, we who carefully construct our artifices, each for a separate audience. (She laughs, throwing her head back, because she read in Cosmo once that men find that attractive.) Non-illusory transparency is terrifying because of its accompanying vulnerability, yes, but also because it cannot mold to its audience: when the actor is naked on stage he’s the same naked every day, though the cadence or the inflections of his monologue might change. We wear different selves based on mood and weather and surroundings, and to imagine that this power might be taken from us—well, what would they <i>think</i>?</p><p>I like the discomfort of the nude actor. It reminds me how few people I know as their naked selves. But it <i>is</i> discomfort, and this may have been part of what upset my mother. Then again, we were her daughters, and there was a naked man on stage. Why cloak the truth of the thing in verbiage?</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
