    <article>
        <p><p>If watching TV was a sport, there was a time in my life in which I would have qualified for  Olympic gold. When I was about nine years old I spent more time watching TV than most people spend working. I can recite the first episode of <i>Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy</i> verbatim. I can name so many characters from <i>The Fairly Oddparents</i> that it’s slightly disturbing. I know enough commercial jingles to fill a jukebox.</p><p>	My taste in TV was completely indiscriminate—I watched everything from <i>Thomas the Tank Engine </i>to <i>Wife Swap.</i> <i>Unwrapped </i>and <i>The Barefoot Contessa </i>on the Food Network. <i>Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide </i>and <i>George Lopez </i>on Nick at Nite. Both American and Japanese versions of <i>Ninja Warrior. </i>That one game show where you get cash prizes for trying to put your body through increasingly small holes in sheets of foam.</p><p>	The only place I drew the line was the <i>Disney Channel</i>, as I thought myself above the network's tendency towards middle-school histrionics about boys and clothes and makeup. In retrospect it seems hard to justify my standards of intellectual and artistic merit when it included the Home Shopping Network and <i>Diners, Drive-ins and Dives</i> <i>with Guy Fieri</i>.</p><p>	The point is—I watched utter crap, without irony, and enjoyed it. I’d come home from school, diligently fill out my math and grammar worksheets, and proceed to sit in front of the tube until it was time to go to bed. I don’t think anyone really understood the depth of my TV habit. My elementary school friends suffered under tight restrictions on “screen time” and parroted their elitist parents by saying things like “We don’t even <i>own</i> a TV” or “I’m much too busy to watch TV” both of which made me roll my eyes so hard my pupils were in danger of getting permanently glued to my skull. As such the conversation never progressed much from there. My parents seemed equally oblivious— I mentioned my pathological love of television to them a few weeks back and they seemed unfazed, as if that whole thing was a dream they’d forgotten.</p><p>	Over time, my TV habit waned. With my discovery of Netflix and Hulu and eventually, torrenting, I didn’t have to unconsciously flip through channel upon channel of crap anymore. In middle and high school I kept up with a few shows here and there, but no longer with the same mindless, compulsive quality. This last semester I watched an episode of <i>Black Mirror </i>and that was it.</p><p>	It’s strange to have become a Person Who Does Not Really Watch TV. Mostly I just feel ashamed. When my mother or a hairdresser asks me if I’ve been watching anything good recently, I pause for an awkward amount of time to think of an answer that makes me sound the least like an asshole. I want to say that it’s not that I’m <i>above </i>TV, it’s just that I haven’t been watching it. But the thing is: there is no way to say “I haven’t been watching much TV these days” without implying that you have better things to do. I hear myself mumble “I just don’t really have the time” and think of all those people I rolled my eyes at when I was a kid. I hear my younger self say: “Really? You don’t have 30 minutes to watch <i>Atlanta </i>or <i>Westworld </i>or even <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians? </i>What happened to you?”</p><p>	While part of it is, of course, that I’ve changed, TV has also changed along with me. When I was a kid, my approach to TV wasn’t teleological. I didn’t watch particular shows— I just <i>watched</i>. I felt no need to find out what happened next in <i>Degrassi</i> or <i>Ace of Cakes</i> or <i>Spongebob Squarepants—</i> what I was looking for was a strange numb meditative state in which I could empty out my mind and just tune in.</p><p>	Now it’s much harder, I find, to get this sort of a fix from TV.  With the advent of streaming services I can now watch whatever I want. In this context, why would I pick <i>Wife Swap </i>over <i>Game of Thrones?</i> <i>Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee </i>over <i>Broad City</i>? Even if I chose to watch an objectively bad show, it’s still a <i>choice</i>. Watching TV becomes way to engage with culture the same way I’d go see a well-reviewed movie or buy a book a friend recommends.</p><p>	Some would argue that the analogue to my younger self’s compulsive TV consumption is the Netflix binge. But even when I mindlessly click “Next Episode,” I’m still working towards an end goal of <i>having watched the show—</i> it’s still fundamentally <i>productive</i>. To put it another way: I would never have admitted to watching six consecutive hours of <i>Deal or No Deal </i>the same way I’d humblebrag about binging the entirety of, say, <i>Rick and Morty </i>in one night.</p><p>	I admit that this could all be facile, an over-intellectualization. Maybe I stopped watching so much bad TV simply because I found better things to do. And maybe my life is better for the fact that I don’t spend 9 hours a day catatonic in front of a flashing screen. But either way, when I came home from break to find my brother watching his third hour of <i>Family Feud, </i>I’d never felt more at home. </p></p>
