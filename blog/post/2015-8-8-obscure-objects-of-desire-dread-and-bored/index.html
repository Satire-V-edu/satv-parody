Apparently shocked and pathetically drenched, she stops chasing him. Mirroring the train</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s inevitable progress toward its destination, a handful of flashbacks go by, and we learn that Conchita has been repeatedly goading Mathieu with sexual promises she doesn</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t keep, turning him on and frustrating him in equal and increasing measure.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">She</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s saving herself for marriage, she says; Ma</span> <span class="s1">thieu, thinking gratification is just around the corner, puts up with it. One night, he discovers Conchita performing some kind of strip-Flamenco for seedy tourists. Nearly foaming at the mouth, Mathieu stops the show and interrogates her. He knew she worked as a dancer, but <i>this</i>?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s2">“</span><span class="s1">Oh please…</span><span class="s2">” </span><span class="s1">Conchita shrugs. She seems surprised that Mathieu could have been so na</span><span class="s2">ï</span><span class="s1">ve. </span><span class="s2">“</span><span class="s1">Even children know about this.</span><span class="s2">”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And here, Mathieu</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s face is priceless.</span><span id="more-1778"></span></p><p class="p1"><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-08-at-7-22-08-pm.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-08-08 at 7.22.08 PM" class=" wp-image-1779 aligncenter" height="267" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-08-at-7-22-08-pm.png?w=387&amp;h=267" width="387"/></a></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is more or less how one feels after reading Tom McCarthy’s latest novel <i>Satin Island </i>(Knopf, 2015). This clever, vexing novel follows an anthropologist named U. working for a corporation whose leader asks him to </span><span class="s4">“</span><span class="s5">write the Great Report… the Book. The First and Last Word on our age… What I want you to do, he said, is <i>name</i> what</span><span class="s4">’</span><span class="s5">s taking place right now.</span><span class="s4">”</span><span class="s1"> This assignment forms part of the Koob-Sassen Project, an enterprise so big and insidious that </span><span class="s2">“</span><span class="s1">there</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s probably not a single area of your daily life that it hasn</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t, in some way or other, touched on, penetrated, changed; although you probably don</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t know this.</span><span class="s2">” </span><span class="s1">So, bopping about Europe and working on this report, U. floats between half-baked revelations about the Internet and the suicidal undertone of parachuting before arriving in Manhattan</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">which he</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s imbued with central significance by way of a Borgesian dream-sequence</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">only to realize that when he gets there, nothing happens. It</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s a novel of sexy ideas, none of which fully reveals itself before becoming something new.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m a longtime McCarthy fan, and for those who are too, I think it’s safe to say that <i>Satin Island is </i> more of a distant cousin to his 2005 <i>Remainder</i> than a logical follow-up to his 2010 <i>C</i>. But what concerns me is not so much defining <i>Satin Island</i>‘s place in McCarthy’s work as understanding its structure among works like it. Why? Because, despite its seeming improvisation, this type of plot</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">the plot that writers like Jonathan Franzen typically avoid by way of dramatic structure so tight it would make Aristotle blush</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">has an ample tradition. It’s everywhere, actually. If you pressed me to describe its structure, I</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">d say it</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s as though one of the great meta-detectives novels of our time (Haruki Murakami</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s <i>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and The End of the World</i>, Thomas Pynchon</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, or Paul Auster</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s <i>The New York Trilogy</i> are all good examples) took a wrong turn in its controlled universe of clues and twists, questions and answers, and ended up in a surreal landscape like those of Yves Tanguy, where nothing has any weight and everything seems to be slowly falling apart.</span>¹</p><p class="p1"><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/download.jpeg"><img alt="download" class="size-medium wp-image-1780 aligncenter" height="158" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/download.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=158" width="300"/></a></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, novels like <i>Satin Island</i> have less in common with the literary mysteries cited above than with the novels of Roberto Bola</span><span class="s2">ñ</span><span class="s1">o or films like Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of Pynchon</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s <i>Inherent Vice: </i>detective fiction so meta it</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s transcendent and so soft-boiled it</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s practically uncooked. Like Pynchon’s stoned detective, this type of story follows a series of false clues and fanciful asides before resolving a central problem unsatisfactorily, wonkily, forcing you to realize that its subject is not that obscure object of desire but its relentless chasers.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">Dragging along U.</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s rote sex life (“I tried to have sex with her again, but she wasn</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t interested; she just finished off her cigarette…”) and the progressive death of his (only?) friend, <i>Satin Island</i>, like Mathieu, chases a sublime understanding of the desired object, but doesn’t catch it. It’s as if Mathieu were on a mission to define the intricacies of the late capitalist landscape and the answer were “Conchita.”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This style has its virtues; first among them is that it furnishes pretext for unrelenting subtlety. Attitudes, atmospheres, and general vibes are given exquisite attention while allowing scenes to linger in a haze of detached mirth. Nothing really <i>has</i> to happen, so nothing does. As U., the narrator of McCarthy’s book warns early on, “<i>events</i>! If you want those, you</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">d best stop reading now.” Instead, to move itself forward, the story relies on a constant climate of low-level dread and metaphysical anxiety. Roberto Bola</span><span class="s2">ñ</span><span class="s1">o</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s novels epitomize this technique. Take his monstrous cast of characters in his 650-page <i>The Savage Detectives</i>: often, instead of generating the events that form a good story, Bola</span><span class="s2">ñ</span><span class="s1">o</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s characters simply predict future events</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">vague ones</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">that are generally undesirable and bad-sounding. Here, giving off high levels of dread, one such character forecasts the shadowy destiny of Bola</span><span class="s2">ñ</span><span class="s1">o</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s two protagonists Ul</span><span class="s2">í</span><span class="s1">ses and Arturo (the eponymous detectives) and the novel as a whole.</span></p><p class="p3" style="padding-left:60px;"><span class="s1">“Now let</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s take the desperate reader, who is presumably the audience for the literature of desperation. What do we see? First, the reader is an adolescent or an immature adult, insecure, all nerves. He</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s the kind of fucking idiot (pardon my language) who committed suicide after reading <i>Werther</i>… Furthermore: desperate readers are like the California gold mines. Sooner or later they</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">re exhausted! Why? It</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s obvious! One can</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t live one</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s whole life in desperation. In the end the body rebels, the pain becomes unbearable, lucidity gushes out in great cold spurts… I told them [Ul</span><span class="s2">í</span><span class="s1">ses and Arturo] so. I warned them… I alerted them to the dangers. Don</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t exhaust the vein! Humility! Seek oneself, lose oneself in strange lands! But with a guiding line, with bread crumbs or white pebbles! And yet I was mad, driven mad by them, by my daughters, by Laura Dami</span><span class="s2">á</span><span class="s1">n, and so they didn</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t listen.”</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">The reader is thus hooked; she keeps reading, waits to see whether these predictions are right. What will happen to Ul</span><span class="s2">í</span><span class="s1">ses and Arturo? Will their bodies give out to their desperation? And what about that bit about the suicide? Might they fall into a similar trap? Similarly, consider McCarthy</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s portentous description of U.</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s in-flight sleep after he</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s watched a television report on an oil spill:</span></p><p class="p3" style="padding-left:60px;"><span class="s1">“… oil seemed to lie around the very cloud-patches the wing-lights were illuminating: to lurk within and boost their volume, as though absorbed by them, and to seep out from them as well, in blobs and globules that hovered on their ledges, sat about their folds and crevasses, like so many blackened cherubs.”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or of the ventilation system in his office, in which the novel</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s entire argument is contained:</span></p><p class="p3" style="padding-left:60px;"><span class="s1">“It was cavernous and booming… Other, vaguer voices hovered in the general noise</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">or if not voices, at least patterns, with their ridges and their troughs, their repetition frequencies, their cadences and codas. Sometimes these patterns took on visual forms, like those that so enchanted eighteenth century scientists when they scattered salt on Chladni plates and, exposing these to various acoustic stimuli, observed the intricate design that ensued… I, too, in my basement, sometimes thought I saw… the plan, formula, solution… before, waking with a jolt, I watched it all evaporate, like salt in a quiet breeze.”</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">McCarthy</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s talent for dread</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">that feeling of something big lurking beyond the present, something whose contours you can only make out for a second</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">is enough to power his novel too. Yet, at the same time, when these portentous monologues go on for 26 chapters, as they do in<i> The Savage Detectives</i>, or last an entire book, as in <i>Satin Island</i>, the reader</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s anticipation often becomes boredom</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">albeit a happy boredom which pleases us because it’s still fueled by foreboding. As Adam Phillips observes in his psychoanalytic classic <i>On Kissing, Tickling, and Being Bored</i>: </span><span class="s2">“</span><span class="s1">For the adult, it seems, boredom needs to be the more permanent suspended animation of desire.</span><span class="s2">” </span><span class="s1">Reading, we know that nothing is happening, and yet we</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">re helplessly strung along by the desire that something might. ²</span></p><p class="p4"><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/download-1.jpeg"><img alt="download (1)" class="size-full wp-image-1781 aligncenter" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/download-1.jpeg?w=670"/></a></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Nine Nights</i> by Bernardo Carvalho is another novel that <i>Satin Island</i> recalls, not only for its sedated plot or its critical preoccupation with an anthropologist, but for the productive way it deals with this desirous boredom. First published in 2002, Carvalho</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s book is a documentary-paced presentation of a twenty-first-century novelist</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s failure to explain the life and death of Buell Quain, an American anthropologist who after graduating from Columbia studied the Krah</span><span class="s2">ô </span><span class="s1">people in Brazil before killing himself among them in 1939.³</span><span class="s1"> Needless to say, there are no events here. The novelist spends almost the entire text weighing hypotheses on Quain: was he </span><span class="s2">“</span><span class="s1">racked by illness</span><span class="s2">”</span><span class="s1">? Was he </span><span class="s2">“</span><span class="s1">in mortal danger</span><span class="s2">”</span><span class="s1">? Is it true that he </span><span class="s2">“‘</span><span class="s1">Forced himself into homosexuality with blacks, of whom he has a horror</span><span class="s2">’”</span><span class="s1">? Even when the book</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s exciting, it</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s boring. Yet, while McCarthy’s anthropologist is meaningfully engaged in watching videos buffer or Carvalho’s novelist is yet again insinuating that Quain was in fact functionally insane, the reader feels this boredom just as strongly as she shares the characters</span><span class="s2">’ </span><span class="s1">exquisite desire. Just as Mathieu</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s frustration is partly pleasurable since it represents the anticipation of a reward, our boredom is partly pleasurable since it waits for the moment in which the book runs out of secrets to keep. This is the moment in which the book either greets its reader with open arms or slithers away, Conchita-like, unwilling to admit to its reader that its story has collapsed.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Nine Nights</i> does the first while <i>Satin Island</i> does the second. This is why <i>Nine Nights </i>wonderfully eschews the smirking tone of a novel driven mostly by ideas. Unlike <i>Satin Island</i>, which ends with U.</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s clever musings on a homeless man trying to use a payphone</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">U. finds him </span><span class="s2">“</span><span class="s1">anachronistic,</span><span class="s2">” </span><span class="s1">perhaps highlighting U.</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s own confusion in defining the present</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1"><i>Nine Nights </i>ends almost tragically, as though the narrator (and Carvalho himself) were sad that he couldn</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t offer you more. After losing his time to reconstructing a Buell Quain that increasingly seems more like a man on a perverse and nostalgic voyage than an anthropologist, the narrator finds himself on a plane back to Brazil.</span></p><p class="p3" style="text-align:left;padding-left:60px;"><span class="s1">“Coincidentally, we were flying over the region where Quain had killed himself. That was when the guy next to me, for the first time, paused and asked me if his light was bothering me. I said no, I could never sleep on planes. He smiled and said he couldn</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t either. He was too excited about his trip to sleep… I asked him if he was going on holiday. He smiled again and responded proudly and enthusiastically: </span><span class="s2">‘</span><span class="s1">I</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">m going to study the Brazilian Indians.</span><span class="s2">’ </span><span class="s1">I couldn</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t manage another word… I suddenly remembered learning, on one of those television shows about ancient civilizations, that the Nazca of the Peruvian desert cut out the tongues of the dead and tied them up in a bag so that they could never return to torment the living. I turned to the other side, fighting my own nature, and tried to sleep, even if only to quiet the dead.”</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">He has good reason to want to quiet the dead; he</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s failed to understand Quain, and what</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s more menacing than a voice beyond the grave accusing you of having given up on them? I’ve been saying that <i>Satin Island</i> is propelled by the same erotic, aimless anxiety found in Bola</span><span class="s2">ñ</span><span class="s1">o and at the thematic core of <i>That Obscure Object of Desire</i></span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">an anxiety that collapses yet doesn’t resolve. This is true of <i>Nine Nights</i> insofar as the voyeur’s desire to know what sordid (or totally banal) secret led Buell Quain to kill himself in Brazil is what makes the novel’s disparate episodes cohere. But as opposed to McCarthy’s characters (who are so hollow they would be more appropriately called <i>concepts</i></span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">or <i>specters</i>), those of Carvalho have a harrowing fullness to them: as a reader, you follow their emotional logic; you get what they’re going through. There’s a bitter sincerity in their quest, a sincerity all but overlooked by McCarthy’s novel and perhaps more apparent in Bola</span><span class="s2">ñ</span><span class="s1">o’s gruesome and redemptive <i>2666</i> than in <i>The Savage Detectives</i>.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">In one of <i>Nine Nights</i>’s more touching scenes we learn that Quain’s ceaseless traveling was for him a way to “try to come back to himself, to a place where he would no longer be forced to see himself” and his death a shortcut to this self-blindness. Such stylistic illogic will be familiar to readers of Bolaño—how exactly does one “come back to himself” by projecting himself endlessly elsewhere, with the biggest elsewhere being death?—but more important, it echoes a familiar and durable literary sentiment, perhaps best distilled by Baudelaire in his memorab</span><span class="s4">le lines, “This life is a hospital where every patient is possessed with the desire to change beds… It always seems to me that I should feel well in the place where I am not.” Similarly universal is the notion that Quain’s “own self took him by surprise.” Who hasn’t felt that? When we read these quips, it’s clear that we’re not just dealing with McCarthy’s existential limbo but with some heavier, more personal stuff: movement as self-hatred, stillness as self-alienation, and desire of the foreign as migration toward death.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is neither better nor worse at a literary level, but it makes for a better read. And it makes it all the more lamentable that Carvalho’s not as well-known around here as Bola</span><span class="s2">ñ</span><span class="s1">o (or as McCarthy for that matter). There</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s something beautiful about writing that knows both when to confuse and when to capitulate—it keeps both writer and reader honest. Are U.</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s scary predictions about insidious corporate influence in our lives correct? Was Buell Quain a fetishist with father problems? In books as meandering as these, as in the case of Conchita and Mathieu, the best revelations are those that disappoint you by being exactly what you knew but didn</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t want to believe.</span></p><p class="p2">By Lucas Quatrecasas ’18</p><p class="p2">¹ <span class="s1">For more on <i>Satin Island</i></span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s rapport with surrealist tendencies like those of Tanguy and Bu</span><span class="s2">ñ</span><span class="s1">uel, check out McCarthy</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s interview with two cats <a href="http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1104929/st-my-cats-read-a-feline-conversation-with-tom-mccarthy"><span class="s3">here</span></a>.</span></p><p class="p2">² <span class="s1">For what it</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s worth, James Wood recognizes both of these novel-forwarding devices in an essay on </span><span class="s2">“</span><span class="s1">Thomas Pynchon and the Problem of Allegory</span><span class="s2">” </span><span class="s1">(included in <i>The Broken Estate</i>, 2010).

Although this last point is of little relevance to the present essay, I</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">d say that the allegorical skeleton of <i>Satin Island</i> is at points disturbingly visible and that equating dream-logic with one</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s personal paradise is practically what made Bola</span><span class="s2">ñ</span><span class="s1">o famous. </span></p><p class="p2">³ <span class="s1">Vintage published an English translation of <i>Nine Nights</i> in 2008.
