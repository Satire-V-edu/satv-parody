Two weeks ago, with my Spanish program, I was preparing to go on a two-day hike among them, in the peaks beyond the Tarma Valley. The route we chose runs ten miles up and down the first day, with a manageable return the next morning. I had never done anything like this before.</p><p>The night before, absent real knowledge, I was full of nervous eagerness. I had good reason to be nervous: although the hike would have been manageable in the Appalachians, even though I’m not in shape, this trail was above twelve thousand feet. As I had begun to learn, I don’t do very well at altitude. But we had spent the past day and a half exploring the region, thrilling to the beauty of the mountains, so I was also eager to start. I expected that the next days would be unforgettable, even more gorgeous than what we had seen, and that, if anything, this unaccustomed physical exertion would add vividness to my memories. A shooting star outside seemed to augur well for our endeavors.</p><p><span id="more-1004"></span></p><p>The next morning, we drove to a valley below the first mountain slope we would ascend. The valley was flat, something more than five hundred yards across, with a little lake at the far end of it. The whole valley was full of water – I had not expected there to be so much water in the Andes. Our path took us around a series of lakes, but I had thought they would be lakes in a dry land. Instead, this valley and others were marshy. Little streams ran everywhere, and the floor of each valley was covered with pans of water just too well-established to be called mere puddles. The mood of the sky changed quickly up there; you could always see it reflected in the valley.</p><p>The Cordillera Negra looming before us, we climbed that first ascent under a gray sky. After making it to the top, we walked a long stretch within the clouds themselves. When we reached a high and unused road, a little after noon, the sun finally came out. The Cordillera Negra caught the clouds as they departed, puffy and no longer ominous in the newly-minted sunshine. The last of the lakes we saw that day, in the late afternoon, was Mamacocha, “Mother of Waters” in Quechua. There was no visible entrance or outlet to the lake, so it was absolutely still between the high gray cliffs surrounding. After that, me needing some help to do so, we climbed a steep zigzag path up to the shepherd’s house where we would spend the night.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, I was already doing badly by the time we made it to the end of the day’s first stretch, at the end of that first flat valley. This was early in our trek, less than a mile from where we had started. Contrary to my expectations that the difficulty would add savor to what I was seeing, my exhaustion argued mostly that I shouldn’t have done this without more preparation. From the plain of that first valley, the humps in the ground, five or eight feet tall, had started to look much taller. From the very first slope, which the experienced members of the group did admit was the hardest we would make that day, I started wondering if I would make it. I didn’t think I would faint, but the possibility crossed my mind more often than I would have liked. My hands started to look further away than they should have. Although water helped and I did better after making it to that top, I never stopped struggling. Putting one foot in front of the other consumed too much energy.</p><p style="text-align:center;"> ♠</p><p>Some images are preserved in your memory forever, in all their detail, texture, and color. When I remember any of the things I saw that day, when I look at the pictures I managed to take, I feel that these images ought to be among them. They are not. While I do think I will remember the places I saw that day forever, I already see them as if they were sand etched on glass, a paler, more translucent form of memory.</p><p>I remember with utmost vividness the pain in my hands as we walked among the clouds. Earlier, I had sat down too readily on an unfriendly patch of marsh grass, which covered my hands in dozens of translucent spikes like bees’ stingers. Now I needed my hands free to balance, so I could not tuck them into my coat. I don’t remember why I refused to put on my gloves. The mist was cold, and it stung. I remember shaking with cold much later, on the last late ascent, as the temperature started to drop before nightfall. But the rainbow that once flashed below us, say, or the glorious golden light of sunset in the mountains—I already remember these more from pictures than from memory.</p><p>The friends who did it with me talk about this hike as a thing to have accomplished, how much they will remember of everything. I am glad I did it, but I am struck by how indistinct my memories are, of the vagueness of their beauty. This is no less true for the things I saw in the first mile than the things I saw in the ninth; a haze lies over everything. I got more out of it than perhaps I should have expected, given how little I could do at altitude, but aside from four or five images, it is all a beautiful blur.</p><p style="text-align:center;"> ♣</p><p>I was surprised at how much water there was in the Andes, but clean water was still hard to find. In Peru, as in many places in the world, you shouldn’t drink the tap water. In places like the shepherd’s house where we stayed overnight, there is no tap. They call tea “water,” in the diminutive form, because water is only safe boiled. We were carrying water with us, too, but in the house I was grateful that they gave us tea.</p><p>The shepherd had a son, Renzo, who was three. I reached the house first, so I sat there clutching my hot mug, trying to warm up and to make friends with the kid. When the others arrived, our professor, who spent much of his childhood nearby, poured some water from his bottle into a ceramic bowl. He offered it to Renzo, saying that this was water—he should try it. Renzo took the bowl with cold, purified water, bigger than his head, and sipped from it. He finished that one. After tasting sparkling water, which the professor described as “like soda, but without taste,” Renzo screwed up his face and went to hide in a corner.</p><p>Renzo had never had plain, clean water before, at least not as far as he remembered. Maybe it was that I was finally warm myself and my thoughts were working again; maybe it was the way the sunlight piercing into that room caught the child in profile as he drank; maybe it was all the pent-up wonder I was too tired to direct at the landscape during the day, but at this, I was amazed.</p><p> </p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
