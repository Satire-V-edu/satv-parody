In part one, the group discussed Seresin’s</span> <span class="s1">“A Love Letter to My Stepmom”</span> <span class="s1">and Scherlis’</span> <span class="s1">“Their Party.”</span> <span class="s1">In the abridged transcription below, the group discusses Zhang’s “Full Circle: (Exotic) Odysseys Through (Oriental) Rainforests on (Outlawed) Tour Buses,” Lewis’</span> <span class="s1">“When the Mammy Sphinx Gawks Back at You!”.</span><span id="more-1672"></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Caleb Lewis: I think out of all of our pieces it is Faye’s, “Full Circle: (Exotic) Odysseys Through (Oriental) Rainforests on (Outlawed) Tour Buses,” that deals the least explicitly with the theme of possession. However, I do see the thread running through the piece in subtler ways. Faye, would you mind speaking about your piece through the lens of possession?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Faye Yan Zhang: I found material possession very interesting. My piece is about traveling through China’s Yunnan province. In particular, it is about the very touristy area of Xishuangbanna, which some people have taken as a pun to mean “twenty dollars,”</span> <span class="s1">because “shuang”</span><b> </b><span class="s1">means, “twice.”</span> <span class="s1">I found that tourism aspect very interesting. What struck me the most was how Buddhism is very commodified, all over China, but in that area in particular. A lot of people are Buddhist in the province and it’s home to a lot of ethnic minorities. In some ways, Buddhism has become a bit of a theme park. People in the United States think of it as very spiritual, very concerned with giving things up, but when we went to Xishuangbanna, we went to a Buddhist temple and it was basically like a theme park. It was built on a hill, and on the top of the hill there was a gigantic golden statue of Buddha. It was actually made out of plaster and painted gold. There were different levels on the hill and there was a different temple on each level. In each temple there was a different attraction. People tried to sell you things, and tried to get you to donate. On one level there was sacred tree where you could pay twenty dollars to hang your name on the tree and be guaranteed salvation for you and your family. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was an interesting painting in one of the main temples near the top. It was a large space and inside there was a giant statue of the Buddha. Around the back there were these floor to ceiling paintings depicting the life of Buddha. They were really strange, almost psychedelic. There were flying spaceships in one of them and all sorts of vibrant colors and shapes. I went around to the back of the Buddha and there was a giant face of a demon. I remember being interested as to why that was, why the artist chose to do that. It felt to me as if the demon was possessing the Buddha from behind, which reminded me a lot of the commodification of the religion in general.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Indiana Seresin: What I loved so much about your piece, Faye, was that it complicated the binary between commodification and spirituality, or authenticity and inauthenticity especially in a traveling context. A lot of travel writing will come from a privileged western position, and a lot of it is striving towards this weird ethereal, authentic experience, which of course is completely inaccessible to anyone with money coming from the west. I thought the way that it disrupted that question of authenticity was great. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It also brought Los Angeles to mind. My dad lives in LA and I think LA is a prime example of a place that’s so deeply committed to spirituality on its face. There are so many stores that sell incense and very vague symbols of Buddhism and other Eastern religions. I think that vagueness covers up what in your piece is so obviously commodification. The vagueness shows that it’s even more commodified because there’s nothing substantial beneath it.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Julian Lucas: In your piece, Faye, you describe how the Han Chinese ethnic group owns most of the property in the region that you traveled to. It made me wonder how going there and trying to have an authentic experience of the culture was effected by that outside possession of the space.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">FYZ: In my piece I talk about how the main non-Han ethnic group in Xishuangbanna are the Dai people, and just like there are Buddhism theme parks, there are Dai theme parks where you can go in an tour an authentic Dai village.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">JL: With people living there? Are they actually called theme parks?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">FYZ: They aren’t, they market themselves as completely authentic: like they’re real people who live there all the time and that the village has been preserved throughout the years. But they’re not, they’re lying to you. Those houses have been built in the last five or ten years capitalizing on tourism. The people who live there are ethnic Dai people, but they’re earning money by bringing Han people into their homes, almost like a road show or a spectacle. And I don’t know if its completely wrong for them to do that, it is their livelihood and how they make their livings.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">JL: All three of you—Caleb, Faye, and Lily—wrote pieces about who owns a certain spectorial space.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily talks about entering this vodou space, and wondering if westerners are allowed, Faye talks about the Han entering a Dai minority space, and Caleb, you talk about trying to take back an artistic space that’s been defined by the white gaze. It’s interesting to me that all three of you dealt with that: experiencing a place based on who owns that place.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">CL: I also saw some connections, especially between my piece and Faye’s. On the face at least, we both deal with spaces that are inhabited by a minority but are controlled by a majority. In my piece I considered Kara Walker’s Marvelous Sugar Baby exhibit, and thought a lot about how many of the problems that I saw with the reception of the piece came in the form of people wanting to go and look and possess, but not being willing to let themselves be possessed by the art. What I mean by that is they were looking to enjoy and critique art but not willing to engage critically with themselves as a result of it. They weren’t willing to let the art “see”</span> <span class="s1">them. I think that’s something that happens quite a bit when you have art that stems from a long history of marginalization and oppression. It’s hard to get people to finally bring it in from the margins and take it seriously, and think about themselves and their culpability in relation to the long history that it represents. So in the end, I argue that we, conscious art lovers, need to give those pieces eyes, “oppositional gazes,”</span> <span class="s1">to borrow phrase from the writer bell hooks, that allow them to look privilege in the eyes.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">IS: It’s interesting that you framed that sort of engagement as being possessed: not wanting to confront what these pieces are really saying is not wanting to be possessed. In some ways that’s antithetical to what may be the obvious way of thinking about possession, but it’s interesting because I think that’s the form of possession that’s very much at play in Lily’s piece, which is letting go, getting outside the ego, and allowing your consciousness to be impacted by something that’s in front of you. That’s something that art would ideally do, especially art made by people in the margins, by people whose voices you aren’t going to be confronting everyday. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">FYZ: I like these two ideas of possession that we’re playing with. In my mind, one of the types of possession, which may be the kind that Indiana and Lily talk about is like putting your hand in a glove and fully embodying something, but the other type of possession is casting a net over something without embodying it. That’s what happens in my piece and Caleb’s piece.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lily Scherlis: In either one, the result is the same. You still gain control over something, just via the inside or the outside.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">JL: I’m thinking about the title of your piece, Caleb, “When the Mammy Sphinx Gawks Back at You!”</span> <span class="s1">and the whole idea of the oppositional gaze and the art not being looked at, but illuminating the spectators. We have a Kara Walker painting in the issue that I put next to your piece; it’s called “Dreams Herself Into Being.”</span> <span class="s1">In the painting, the form of the sphinx is just blank canvas and everything else around it is illuminated by that brightness.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">CL: I talked a little about that idea in the piece, how I thought Walker’s decision to cast the sphinx in bright white refined sugar as opposed to molasses was very telling. When you walked into the dark space of the derelict factory and encountered this blinding white mammy figure, it was almost like a reversal of the social order, one that I thought was pretty explicit in demanding you think about what exactly she was illuminating. I think that was lost on people, that playing with light and darkness.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">JL: In the piece you mentioned Betye Saar and how she’s not a fan of Walker’s.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">CL: Not at all, she led a letter writing campaign back in the 90’s trying to get Walker’s work barred from museums and galleries.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">JL: You also mentioned Betye Saar’s piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” another sort of stereotype-reclamation piece. It’s Aunt Jemima as warrior, essentially. So as two artists who deal with the repossession of stereotypical images, what do you think is the difference between Saar and Walker?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">CL: I think especially among black artists who have seen a lot of success in the mainstream art world, there’s a lot of pressure to be triumphant. In my piece I quote James Baldwin who refers to Richard Wright as one of the only Negroes invited to the cocktail party of the white man’s world. I think that description is really telling. I think that aloneness in itself produces a lot of pressure to reflect well and be respectable.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">FYZ: You said be “triumphant?”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">CL: Yes. So I grew up in Cincinnati, which is still a pretty racially segregated city—it definitely has its enclaves. I remember driving or walking through some of the black neighborhoods and seeing street vendors selling black art, but it was always of muscular men pulling themselves up on ladders or of women with long braids wearing the crown of Nefertiti. They were images that were very triumphant and very romantic and kind of propagandistic in a way. For the longest, that’s what I thought that art made by black people looked like. Because there’s so little</span> <span class="s1">“positive”</span> <span class="s1">black representation in our society, I think that being a black person who has the opportunity to create culture is to be a person who is under a lot of pressure to make that art explicitly “positive.”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">FYZ: That’s interesting, your description of that art reminds me of Chinese communist era art.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">CL: Yeah it’s empowering, and I certainly understand why it’s something that a people who have been marginalized throughout history would want to see, but I think it can kind of boxes the genre in.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">None of this is to criticize artists who criticize Walker. I think a lot of this comes about as a result of a generational divide. Many of them may worked in a time when it was important as artists to affirm the basic humanity of black people in ways more explicit than what we see, need, and want today. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">IS: I also think that at all times, different people depending on their positionality feel more or less able or more or less willing to have a “fuck you I’m not playing to your terms,”</span> <span class="s1">mentality, or feel like they need to first affirm their existence as a person. In some ways it seems sort of futile to say one way or another is better or worse because undoubtedly you need that radical push, you need that step beyond declaring that you have a right to be at the cocktail party. On the other hand, if someone is having the experience where they feel like they need to affirm their basic worth to keep making art and contributing and changing things, we can’t deny that either. You need them both.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">JL: I’m thinking about Caleb’s example of the street art. What we’re talking about seem to be two very different ways of playing by the rules, of recognizing the white gaze, so to speak. One way of doing that is creating the opposite of what it sees, like the street vendors, but the other, more dangerous, I would say more interesting but sometimes more negative way would be something like what Kara Walker is doing, which is supposed to reflect a warped version of what that gaze expects to see.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">IS: I think the issue also is that you have the author’s intentions and the piece’s intentions, and on the other hand you have audience reception which seems to work in opposition to what the piece seems to be saying. It feels like there are all these conflicting forces that there’s no way of having a simple binary of one type of work that’s playing by the terms of the oppressor and one that isn’t.</span></p><p class="p1"><em>Transcribed by Caleb Lewis ’17</em></p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
