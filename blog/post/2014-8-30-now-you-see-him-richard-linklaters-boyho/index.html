Imagine now that your superpower is actually just extreme diligence, and that you are the director Richard Linklater. The product of this is <em>Boyhood</em>, a languorous dip into the formative years of a young boy in suburban Texas and a feat of filmmaking stamina. Its innovation was to film the same cast for a few days out of every year for twelve years, and for a time after seeing it I wondered whether its power rests solely in its gimmick. After all, <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2014/07/17/boyhood-gets-much-out-its-young-star-and-cinema-itself/yTixjbcHhCCOTKY2b8000I/story.html"><em>The Boston Globe </em></a>had gone so far as to declare that it “may be why the movies were invented.” And yet, what it has to say about boyhood, or parenthood, or generalized personhood, resides squarely in the banal. It is the opposite of Terence Malick’s <em>The Tree of Life</em>, which situates its portrait of Texas boyhood in the context of nothing less than the incipient universe and the beginning of life on Earth. That film opens with a quotation from Job 38:4, 7 (“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? …”) set to John Tavener’s “Funeral Canticle,” and ends with a surrealistic beachscape of the dead. <em>Boyhood</em> opens on a little boy cloud-watching to the strains of Coldplay’s “Yellow,” and ends with him, twelve years later, getting stoned in a national park.</p><p><span id="more-1471"></span>“Life,” Linklater suggests, is better captured in a representative sampling than in extremes. It’s not your first day of school or even your mom’s second wedding so much as the time your dad took you bowling or the time in elementary school you were coerced into a terrible haircut. <em>Boyhood</em> doesn’t disregard the conventional logic that life rarely resolves organically into a compelling story so much as question whether a film needs a story at all. There are calamities, but they don’t begin to present themselves in the manner of a central quest or tension. The film maintains a tone that is purposely level. Dangers, for the most part, are subtle, and come to nothing. A scene where middle-school Mason (Ellar Coltrane) throws around a saw blade with friends seems destined to end with a skull split open, but doesn’t. In another he looks at a phone for three seconds too long while driving, as if to explain the impending crash that never happens. Still, <em>Boyhood</em> is a minor marvel. It feels like more than the sum of its parts—even though the part where Linklater films the same people over twelve years is clearly indispensable. Ultimately, what distinguishes <em>Boyhood</em> from time-lapse photography is its emotional stakes; what makes it different from novels is its visceral seamlessness. Through its condensed portrait of incremental change, the “gimmick” of time’s passage is anchored to a larger project; <em>Boyhood</em> moves by the inevitability of loss, if not the cunning of plot.</p><p>Multiple critics have suggested a slight disingenuousness to the movie’s title: protagonist Mason seems more an orbiting point for the lives of a whole cast of characters than a definitive central consciousness. Wai Chee Dimock in the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em> called it “steadfastly intersubjective… a crowdsourced modern epic, voluminous and interminable.” We follow Mason as he grows from a thoughtful kid who just wants to know if elves are real into a mellow, floppy-haired teen with his first job and serious girlfriend. But we also follow Mason’s sister Sam (Lorelei Linklater) with near-equal attention until she hits adolescence and leaves for college. We watch Mason’s mother, Olivia (Patricia Arquette) as she tries to make a better life for herself and her children. Along the way, she marries first a professor, then a student, both terrible husbands. Though Olivia is depicted mostly in struggling, we see the affable, fly-by-night Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) as his children probably do: with the non-custodial parent’s advantage of having fun time all the time. When he finally trades in the black Pontiac GTO for a baby-friendly minivan, Mason Sr. laments to his now-adult son that things didn’t work out between him and Olivia—he couldn’t be the kind of person he should have been when she needed him to be it. On the one hand, this is merely a reflection on the vicissitudes of time and relationships. And yet, one wonders whether the difference between Olivia and Mason Sr. was really that he wasn’t temperamentally capable growing up then, or if young mothers don’t tend to have a choice.</p><p>The film loosely transplants Linklater’s own boyhood into the experience of growing up in the 2000s, the autobiographic mapped onto the generic. Mason’s family draws heavily on Linklater’s: his parents were also separated; he too was primarily raised by his mom, who went back to school to study psychology when he was a boy. A birthday scene in which Mason receives a shotgun and monogrammed Bible from his step-grandparents corresponds to a real-life Christmas that Linklater calls his “redneck bar mitzvah.” But the film’s temporal identifiers are deliberately universal; there’s a way in which <em>Boyhood</em>‘s banal vision results in a banality of cultural reference. Ellar Coltrane and I share a birth year, and for anyone around our age <em>Boyhood</em> is an uncanny revisiting of pop cultural trivia we absorbed at our most impressionable and subsequently forgot. The soundtrack is a little bit like that feature of Spotify that says, “‘Somebody That I Used to Know’ was huge when you were a teenager. Play now?” Linklater enlisted his two young stars for help choosing the movie’s music, but their adolescent tastes turned out to be too specific: Ellar liked Rage Against the Machine and Lorelei liked harpsichord music. Insofar as <em>Boyhood</em> “happened” to me, it happened to almost every young-ish person in the Western world.</p><p>Linklater is interested in film for its capacity to preserve, but not to indulge the illusion that things never have to change. Rather, in <em>Boyhood</em>, art’s capacity to arrest time actually emphasizes time’s inexorability. It’s unclear whether Mason’s burgeoning love of photography is a stand-in for Linklater’s discovery of filmmaking, but the parallel is apt. The paradox of art plays out in the same way in Mason’s photography as it does in Linklater’s movie. In one scene, Mason and his high school girlfriend visit the University of Texas at Austin together, warm in the revelatory glow of first love. In the next, he dismantles a display of prize-winning photographs he’s taken of her. He lingers over them, we assume with affection, but it turns out to be closer to regret. We realise that their relationship has ended suddenly, bitterly, in the space between. And we are instantly disabused of the idea that successfully suspending something in time is any talisman against mutability.</p><p>The character who addresses the precariousness of time and circumstance most explicitly is Olivia. Her appearances at beginning and end gesture outside <em>Boyhood</em>‘s own temporal bounds. When we first see her, trying to explain to an unsympathetic boyfriend that as a single parent she has certain obligations, she exclaims exasperatedly, “I was somebody’s daughter, and then I was somebody’s fucking mother!” At the film’s close, Mason’s departure for college prompts a tearful reflection on the way life slips away imperceptibly, then stunningly: “Sending Sam off to college, sending you off to college… You know what’s next? Huh? It’s my fucking funeral!” But the moment is precluded from puncturing the film’s general weightlessness by Olivia’s self-consciously comic hysteria and Mason’s response, the unperturbed riposte of youth: “Aren’t you skipping ahead by, like, 40 years?” (He has a point: by the temporal logic of this film, the part where she dies ought to be a solid 10 hours away.)</p><p>This is because <em>Boyhood</em> bears Linklater’s imprint in temperament as well as autobiographical content. As much as is possible for a work of art primarily concerned with the changes—good and bad—wrought by time, <em>Boyhood </em>remains a vehicle for a fundamentally benevolent view of the universe. One minor character occurs and recurs seemingly solely to demonstrate that even the smallest acts of kindness bear life-affirming fruit. Olivia tells a handyman fixing her pipes that he’s too smart not to go to college. Years later, having taken her advice, he reappears with pleasing symmetry as the manager of the upscale restaurant where Mason’s graduation lunch is taking place. But Linklater’s optimism is rendered on a much larger scale, too: given Mason’s itinerant upbringing and the complete dearth of satisfying models of male responsibility, he turns out reassuringly well adjusted and serene. Jesse Barron observed at <a href="https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/reviews/life-events/"><em>n+1</em></a> that Mason remains “[oddly] unaffected by his own growing up… [he] occasionally looks like a teenager who won a contest in a mall and has been invited to appear on a reality show.” Malcolm Harris at <em>T<a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/boy-2-man/">he</a></em><a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/boy-2-man/"> <em>New Inquiry</em></a> criticized it as Linklater lacking the courage of his own portents; in the troubled landscape of contemporary American boyhood, with its “foreshadows of violence and cruelty… Linklater declares victory too early.” It’s certainly possible that individuals could have Mason’s childhood and not be damaged by it. But its cherry-picking of the most popular of pop culture suggests that in some way it seeks to be a topography of communal experience, too, and in that regard it falls short.</p><p>Still, I’m more sympathetic to <em>Boyhood</em>‘s approach. Linklater is, after all, the director who made <em>Dazed and Confused</em> and <em>School of Rock</em>, the consummate cineaste of goofy stoner philosophizing, and he wants you to have a good time. It’s a film of many pleasures: consistently funnier than a good deal of comedies, it provides an affectionate and naturalistic rendering of its characters, especially children. Though Olivia’s outburst near the film’s end presents us with mortality, we aren’t allowed to linger on it too long. Instead, we are swept away by Mason’s enthusiasm as he savours his first taste of the freedoms that college brings. <em>Boyhood</em> depicts loss and change because that’s what life is like. But in Linklater’s universe that only adds to the beauty of it all, as he burnishes to high shine memories we might otherwise discount.</p></p>
