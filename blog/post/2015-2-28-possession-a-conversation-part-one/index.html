In anticipation of the issue’s imminent arrival, features board members Indiana Seresin ’15, Faye Zhang ’17, Caleb Lewis ’17, and Lily Scherlis ’18, sat down with outgoing president Julian Lucas ’15, for a discussion centering on their nonfiction contributions to the magazine, and the many avatars of possession analyzed therein. Below find an abridged transcript of the first of this two-part conversation, in which Seresin’s “A Love Letter to My Stepmom,” and Scherlis’ “Their Party,” are considered. In part two, the group will discuss Lewis’ “When the Mammy Sphinx Gawks Back at You!” and Zhang’s, “Full Circle: (Exotic) Odysseys Through (Oriental) Rainforests on (Outlawed) Tour Buses.”<span id="more-1629"></span></p><p><strong>Caleb Lewis:</strong> Let’s talk first about Indiana’s piece, “A Love Letter to My Stepmom.” It explores the role that possession plays in interpersonal relationships, namely how we all desire to claim and be claimed by the people who we love. After reading the piece, I came away thinking about varying degrees of ownership in relationships and how those levels of possession play roles in determining the types of relationships that we have.</p><p><strong>Indiana Seresin:</strong> Those are absolutely the types of things I was thinking people would come away from it thinking about. A big question for me is the question of ownership and the desire to possess a person in any type of relationship, and how that’s an inclination that we all seem to have, but is also one that seems to be pretty problematic. In the context of this piece, I’m very interested in patterns of possessiveness, particularly the types of claims that parents can have towards their children. Since I’ve come to college I’ve been surrounded by people who generally tend to have grown up with a different parenting style than I did, one that is quite a lot more possessive, and involves this sense of ownership, this sense that the child’s achievements are the parent’s achievements, and that the child’s failures are the parent’s failures. I feel like I have something of an outside perspective in regards to that, not only because my parents aren’t too much like that, but also because such a strong influence in my life has been my relationship with my third parent, my stepmother, who isn’t like that at all. I think that experience has served as this beautiful, complicated, alternative way of having a parent-child relationship that doesn’t necessarily involve these same patterns of possession, at least in the way that traditional parent-child relationships are played out.</p><p><strong>CL:</strong> You mentioned that the need to possess can be pretty problematic, and understandably so. I was struck by that when quoted Simone de Beauvoir in your piece. The quote essentially talks about how the in a mother-child relationship, the mother is possessed by the child and the child is possessed by the mother. I hadn’t thought about it before, but I realized that that ownership is something that particular groups of people have considered, for example radical feminists, and that many of them have encountered it as a societal ill. I’m sure we’ll come back to that.</p><p>But let’s switch to Lily’s piece “Their Party,” which was, I think, a bit of a psychological exploration of the Haitian practice of vodou. You touched a lot upon why the idea of spiritual possession is off-putting to many westerners. Could you talk about that?</p><p><strong>Lily Scherlis:</strong> I initially went into writing the piece thinking that I would take vodou and place it into a western perspective. What I learned very quickly is that there is no good way to do that. If we could do that easily, we wouldn’t have any trouble with the concept of possession. So I ended up flipping the entire concept on its head and interrogating the western perspective from a vodou standpoint, so it became less of a psychological exploration and more of an exploration of what even is “psychology”, why do we have all these structures for analyzing the world around us, and what do we miss when we use them?</p><p><strong>CL:</strong> I read your piece after Indy’s, so I was thinking quite a bit about the reciprocity of possession and how we, as western society, tend to be fine with possession that goes both ways. Perhaps the reason that vodou is so untenable to us is that there seems to be no give and take in our conception of the practice. You give, but you don’t really receive anything.</p><p><strong>LS:</strong> Could you clarify what you mean by reciprocity?</p><p><strong>CL:</strong> Sure, taking the earlier discussion as an example: in a maternal relationship there’s the mother owning the child and the child owning the mother, and that’s almost a form of societally sanctioned possession, because there’s give and take. But when you’re possessed by something that isn’t tangible, the lines blur, perhaps because you aren’t seen as receiving anything in return.</p><p><strong>LS:</strong> I think it is reciprocal, in less of a literal sense. You come away possessing these different personalities and perceptions of the world that inform your experience.</p><p><strong>Julian Lucas:</strong> In her piece, Lily has a great metaphor for a very difficult concept that I often struggle to express in my senior thesis on vodou. The deities in vodou are the loa, and they’re archetypes, they’re principles like love or war, but they’re also accumulations of generations. Lily compares this to a kind of transparency in a projector that you’d have in a classroom where every year more is added to the transparency. In the end, you take all of your ancestors and compress them into the transparency. What is reciprocal is that you’re possessed by this spirit, but you’re also taking possession of a long past, something that Lily captured very well in her piece.</p><p><strong>IS:</strong> Caleb, you used the term, “societally sanctioned,” and there’s kind of an interesting oppositional occurrence between Lily’s piece and mine. The gesture in Lily’s was that not only is vodou something that isn’t socially sanctioned, it’s completely unthinkable and unspeakable in our society. I was trying to do the opposite: suggesting that these types of relationships are disproportionately societally sanctioned. We mentioned radical feminist critique earlier. Even radical feminist critique has stopped criticizing the family since the second wave. For whatever reason the family structure has been enshrined as a safe place that people won’t touch with a critical eye.</p><p><strong>Faye Yan Zhang:</strong> Do you have any insight as to why that may be?</p><p><strong>IS:</strong> I think it happens for a variety of factors, and it’s something that I’m not going to claim to have an authority on. Sarah Ahmed has a great essay called, “Feminists Killjoys,” which talks about this phenomena, where if you’re known as a feminist, all you need to do is open your mouth and someone will start rolling their eyes in anticipation of what they perceive to be you about to bring down the mood. Feminists have had a really rough time critiquing in general, but since the family is supposed to be this source of love and joy, a source of definite good in our lives, I think it becomes especially difficult for feminists to broach that as a subject. It’s sacred for a reason, like: if we don’t have that, what do we have?</p><p><strong>JL:</strong> It’s interesting, in your piece, the one thing you leave to biological parent relationships is this sort of supernatural sense of knowing when something wrong is happening to the child. I thought that was interesting. In the process of editing, I wondered if those represented your actual views on the idea of your mother saying that she could sense when you got hurt.</p><p><strong>IS:</strong> It’s the kind of thing that I often roll my eyes at my mom for saying, but in the piece I talk about how we once got a phone call and she did know that something bad had happened. In many ways I think it’s similar to the types of questions that Lily’s piece brings up. I’m not a particularly empirically minded person, or someone who’s passionate about sticking to scientific explanations for things, but because I’m very critical of the idea that there’s any sort of superiority in biological parent-child relationships, I am resistant to that sort of “supernatural connection.” On the other hand, as Lily is saying in her piece, I don’t have an explanation for it, but that doesn’t take away from what happened.</p><p><strong>CL:</strong> In your piece, Lily, you talked about forms of “possession” that we see in our society. One that you mentioned were eating disorders, and how they can be understood, in the words of the prominent possession scholar Janice Boddy as, “pathological forms of embodied aesthetics.” Would you mind talking more about forms of “spiritual possession” that we see propagated in our society that we wouldn’t normally think of as spiritual possession?</p><p><strong>LS: </strong>The common analogy is schizophrenia, I came up against that a lot in various anthropology papers. I think that gets complicated because those sorts of things are so pathologized that they become separate entities. You can’t separate a lot of these phenomena from the context they’re in: the rules of our society mean that the actual occurrences play out differently, precisely because they are pathologized. I think that the different ways of explaining those occurrences, be it medicine, or what we would label mysticism, just show our capacity as humans to work our way through things that aren’t entirely empirical or obvious or connected to “reality.”</p><p>Read Part Two <a href="http://theadvocateblog.net/2015/03/24/possession-a-conversation-part-two/" title="POSSESSION: A Conversation–Part Two">here</a>.</p><p><em>Transcribed by Caleb Lewis ’17</em></p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
