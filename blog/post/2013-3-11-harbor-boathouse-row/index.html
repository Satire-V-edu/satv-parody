Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org</a></em></p><p>There was once a time, in high school, when I thought I might be an athlete. Cleaning out the attic the Christmas Break of my freshman year, I came  across a faded, musty photo of my great-uncle’s rowing team. They were all tall and toned and stared grimly at the camera, gripping their oars, their faces determinedly blank and pupil-less. The introductory meeting for my high school’s novice crew team was held at the boathouse down on Kelly Drive: dozens of similar photos cluttered the walls, sepia against wall-paneled oak. There is a quiet exclusivity to a sport that needs a river: I felt its tug of history and decided to enroll.</p><p>The Schuylkill was our playing field, bordered by the Victorian gables of Boathouse Row that lit up at night like gingerbread houses. Our dock was the second-to-last and closest to the waterfall dam; a line of ropes stretched out just in front to cling onto if we drifted too close. It wasn’t a real harbor—the Schuylkill curved into the Delaware, which turned south before the Atlantic—but it was the point of departure and the place of return for our creaky but sturdy eight.</p><p><span id="more-774"></span></p><p>When we began morning practices there were days we had to shovel snow off the dock in the dark before we could take out the boat. The fog clung to the water and left dew on our knuckles. As the days became longer, the sun raced us awake, tugging the mist up from the surface. The deep regular beats of each stroke modulated those mornings. No one spoke for the first hour of practice—I kept my eyes on the inward curve of my knees and the swinging braid of the girl in front.</p><p>My hands broke open, bled, and calloused. I was embarrassed  to shake hands. Some days we never made it to the river: we were sent to the steps of the Art Museum to run up and down until we were told to stop. The first few rounds we talked and acted out Rocky; by the end some of us were in tears. I have never been as hungry as I was that semester. As we waited for the bus to take us home we would dig into our backpacks for change, exchanging grubby dimes for soft pretzels from the roadside stand, fifty cents each. Nothing was more perfect than their delicate browned crust, the salt  nestled into the bread like craters.</p><p>Our coach, Steve, was a house painter. He wore overalls to practice and never joined us during runs. The mentality was reliably us against him. All the time and callouses bound us closer together; we began to speak in the first person plural. The river’s seamy legends seeped under our skin and into our origin myth. There was the eight-boat five years before, just out of our memory’s reach, which had dredged up a dead body with their oars. There were the two boys’ team members who had been horsing around until one fell in off the dock, contracted a parasite, and was hospitalized for a month. The stories breathed consequence into our small victories and defeats.</p><p>My parents came to the regattas and mingled under the tents; my dad started to talk about college and recruiting. He didn’t know, and I didn’t yet tell him, that I was already feeling the nostalgia of an ending. By the next year I would throw out my uniform, revert to classes, clubs, and recitals replacing all those hours. If anyone asked if I was athletic I would laugh and shake my head.</p><p>But that year I was trying out lifestyles on the sketchbook of the Schuylkill. I was part of a team whose alignment had to be perfect for us to move at all.  I was six-seat in a boat on a Philadelphia river as cars raced up the highway on both its sides and over its bridges; no matter how fast we went we’d never catch up. They’d be home by now and we’d still be on the river, yanking, tugging, rowing up and down, not really getting anywhere and with nowhere we really had to go.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
