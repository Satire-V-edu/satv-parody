    <article>
        <p><p>The translator’s preface is a curious genre.  I learned this as I studied it this fall for a translation project of my own, a translation of Austrian modernist Robert Musil’s novella <i>Die Vollendung der Liebe</i>.  Although the translator’s preface is not as well-recognized as the sonnet or the sestina, it has a fixed form.  First, the translator introduces the life of the author, often writing paeans to the author’s brilliance—which in reality justifies the <i>translator’s</i> present work.  With this bit of sorcery, the translation borrows the radiance of the original work, like a moon reflecting a sun without producing any light of its own, and the translator’s preface can avoid the real question: what necessitates the translation itself, as an original work?  The next part of the preface shows how the translator tried her best to polish the translation into a perfect mirror reflecting back all the light of the original; but because of the laws of optics, some of the light incident upon that mirror, inevitably, was lost.  The translator can then, in the final section, declare the discovery of a fourth law of thermodynamics: translation is failure, an irreversible process that loses a little bit of the original’s energy in every word of the new work.  And so, ultimately, what began as a justification becomes an apology for the very existence of translation.</p><p>But why not begin with this law of translation as failure as a premise, and build up a commentary from there, instead of deducing the same old law from new evidence?  In this process, it might be possible to justify a new work of translation with appeals to its internal logic and necessity rather than only those of the original.</p><p><span id="more-442"></span></p><p>So, let me start with the axiom: all translation is failure.  That is, all translation is a failure to perfectly transmit all of the qualities of the original.  With that in mind, what justifies a new translation?  Allow me to borrow a concept from Robert Musil’s <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, his masterpiece.  In a famous chapter of this enormous work, Musil introduces the notion of “essayism” through Ulrich, the main character of the novel.  Borrowing largely from Nietzsche, Musil writes the following (in translation, of course, by Sophie Wilkins and Burton Pike):</p><p>The accepted translation of “essay” as “attempt” contains only vaguely the essential allusion to the literary model, for an essay is not a provisional or incidental expression of a conviction capable of being elevated to a truth under more favorable conditions or of being exposed as an error…; an essay is rather the unique and unalterable form assumed by a man’s inner life in a decisive thought.</p><p>Musil’s definition of essayism refers to translation’s failure to fully capture the meaning of the word “essay.”  And yet, Musil does not rail against translation itself but rather against “accepted translation.”  The problem is not with translation’s failure to capture meaning but rather with the failure of a single, fixed translation to capture completely “the unique and unalterable form assumed by a man’s inner life in a decisive thought” in the original work.  In that sense, every new translation can be understood as this type of essay.  If no one translation can contain the “decisive thought” of the original, each one can serve as both an “attempt” and as a “decisive thought” in itself.</p><p>In the same chapter of <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, Musil calls for an understanding of norms, ideals, and so-called truth “as a mobile equilibrium that at every moment requires continual efforts at renewal.”  Perhaps that is how we should understand the relationship between the “truth” of the original text and its versions in the target language.  Each of those versions is one of those one of those attempts, one of those “efforts at renewal” in our understanding of the original text.  And so translation gains an inner necessity of its own, one related to the original text but not necessarily contingent upon it.  There is no fixed, essential truth of the original text in the first place that a translation can aim to transmit.  There is only this “mobile equilibrium.”  In renewing our understanding of the original text, translations maintain this mobile equilibrium.  In other words, the “truth” of the original text requires the translations every bit as much as these require the original.</p><p>The imperfect act of translation itself can be seen, then, as an essay, an attempt—but the original question was how to justify a particular work of translation.  Ulrich, the main character of <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, considers life “a vast experimental station for trying out the best ways of being a man and discovering new ones.”  Perhaps a translation can serve as one of these experiments for figuring out the best ways to render a text, a “decisive thought.”  Each of these experiments will have different parameters and different hypotheses about their results, and some of the experiments will be better conceived and achieved than others.  While translation may maintain and renew the truth of the original text, to justify any individual translation requires that the translator lay out the parameters of her experiment.  That way, it can be judged on its own inner light and not on light borrowed from the original text.</p><p>All translations are indeed failures.  But this failure is a matter of goals.  If the goal of translation is to create the perfect mirror of the original text, this failure is discouragingly absolute.  The laws of thermodynamics are universal; in any real process of translation, there will always be a loss of information.  The only text that contains all of the information of the original text, after all, is the original text.  But if instead the goal of translation is to make an essay, an attempt, an experiment, then failure is simply part of the goal. Some translations are certainly better and more successful than others.  But all translations can do their part in maintaining the “mobile equilibrium” of truth that Musil describes.  If a translation is not a successful experiment, it can at least be an interesting failure.</p><p class="wpa wpmrec">
