    <a href="../../contributor/111.html" class="no-decoration">
        <h2 class="article-author"> Richard Rosen</h2>
    </a>
    
    <article>
        <p><p>Richard Rosen’s “Metaphors of a Cultural Radical,” from the December 1969 issue of the <i>Harvard </i>Advocate, seethes with a brand of rage that feels both relevant and naïve, alternately violently precise and hopelessly scattered. Rosen, a twenty year-old sophomore, was terrified by the institutional violence he witnessed first-hand in the preceding two years, both in his native Chicago at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and at Harvard during the spring 1969 student strike. Rosen, who worked with Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell during his time as an undergraduate, has gone on to write a number of humor books, histories, and sports articles. In reading his revolutionary words—he curses corporate culture and aesthetics, sees President Pusey’s face superimposed on that of every chauvinistic cop-pig, and dreams of a world in which cultural appreciation, rather than the profit motive, might finally win out. </p><p>What can the Younger Generation glean from Rosen’s words today, in the midst of a national reckoning that only appears to getting more surreal by the hour? Have we become too cynical and careful to appreciate the confrontational tone of his complaints? Do his breakdowns of racial politics appear too appropriative given our contemporary understanding of spiritual theft across ethnic lines? Does the relative formlessness of his text reflect what has been retrospectively deemed a hopelessly privileged non-revolution? Does social media make it difficult to effectively criticize individual peers who may be living lives that we find abhorrent? Or are we all reduced to such a confusing ideological morass that we aren’t even confident enough in our own opinions to judge those who we theoretically loathe?   </p><p>At the end of the criminally under-discussed 2015 EDM film <i>We Are Your Friends, </i>Zac Efron’s DJ character lets out a bellow to a mesmerized Summer Fest crowd: “Are we ever going to be better than this?” Is our cultural equivalent to Rosen, then, going to some version of an Internet-art sprite, hopelessly infused with the arguably fascist trappings of corporate music festivals and digital daze? </p><p><wbr></p><p>Here, presented for the first time online, is the full, 4,000-word glory of R.D. Rosen’s polemic against establishment America.</p><p>~ David Kurlander </p><p><br></p><p><strong>In </strong>which the author intends to show that the Revolution is not a war of rhetoric, but a festival, with music in the background; having not even tried to synthesize the thousands of pages he has digested concerning the Revolution, young radicals, and the younger generation. Instead of attempting a conscientious analysis of radical politics, habits, or psychology, he simply remembers certain things as they happened or were thought of and the catchy phrases he jotted down with which to describe them. </p>  <p>Also, in which the author has licentiously used, but forgone the definitions of, many terms, reasoning along with the venerable S.I. Hayakawa that words often have little relation to reality. The only realities that matter here are the tastes of war, racism, poverty, tear gas, and your vision of a better world. </p>  <p>The terms: </p>  <p><i>Military-Industrial Complex </i></p>  <p><i>Neighborhood Theatres </i></p>  <p><i>Older Generation </i></p>  <p><i>Participatory Democracy </i></p>  <p><i>Politics </i></p>  <p><i>Power Elite </i></p>  <p><i>Revolution </i></p>  <p><i>System </i></p>  <p><i>Technocracy </i></p><p><i><br></i></p>  <p><strong>I</strong></p>  <p><strong>There</strong> is one thing we are learning to accept: For so long the recipients of the blessings of an older generation, we are now the recipients of an uncertain wrath. After nineteen, twenty, twenty-one years of precious non-conformity, after an adolescence full of insolence, you and I are paying for it. That sense of humor and charmingly cynical attitude toward our culture that our parents praised us for, that vision of a less turquoise, more individualized society that teachers rewarded us for, are now incurring their hate. The uneasiness we felt at high school dances and our disapproval of Howard Johnson’s did not really disturb our parents; sometimes, they even applauded our discontent. Sneering at politics we were only beginning to understand and hypocrisy they were sure we would learn to rationalize, our disgust was considered youthful arrogance and our grades were considered above average. But now that our disdain for certain scabs and sores has grown into a denunciation of a society we see as irrevocably ill, we are suddenly dangerous and “destructive.” Armed with the same complaints as always, we are no longer loved. In fact, we are even beaten and gassed by an older order strangely afraid of our virility. </p><p><br></p>  <p><strong>II</strong></p>  <p><strong></strong>“I once saw a man he danced with his wife…” </p>    <p><i>“Do the Tighten Up…</i></p>  <p><i>To your left </i></p>  <p><i>And to your right </i></p>  <p><i>Everybody can do it</i></p>  <p><i>But don’t you get too tight.” </i></p>  <p><i></i>Archie Bell and The Drells</p>  <p><i>But say, bards, you keep off our bridges. Keep </i></p>  <p><i>       out of our dreams, </i></p>  <p><i>Dreamers. We want to give this democracy thing </i></p>  <p><i>       they talk</i></p>  <p><i>So big a whirl. We want to see if we are</i></p>  <p><i>      any good</i></p>  <p><i>Out here, we Americans from all over hell. That’s </i></p>  <p><i>      what we want.</i></p>  <p><i></i>Sherwood Anderson</p>  <p>            <i>Song of the Soul of Chicago </i></p><p><i><br></i></p>  <p>On Saturday, August 24<sup>th</sup>, 1968, a hip-yip (it was hard to tell them apart) took off his shirt in Lincoln Park and the White Sox dropped another one to Detroit. Four days later, we forced the system to strip itself. The subliminal repression it had always used successfully to insure its operation was inadequate in the face of a mass demonstration. Its absorbent power, its “repressive tolerance” broke down. When pressed for real answers about the war and racism, the only response was police force and its attendant violence. Perhaps, at first, we looked upon the riots as an aberration of law enforcement, too reminiscent of our impressions of the recent Prague invasion to be wholly American, surely, this wouldn’t happen again. Yet, far from being a case in which the clash of an uncommonly large crowd of demonstrators and an irresistible police force created an unreasonable amount of violence, it was a preview of a coming attraction which would make its way to neighborhood theatres in Berkeley, Madison, and Cambridge. </p>  <p>And when the system stripped for us, what we saw was not a beneficent protective body. The figure, although indisputably male, had soft sagging breasts and wherever he went, twenty cops escorted him. </p>  <p>For many, the fight first came alive in Chicago and it was not difficult to tell the sides: We wore just about any uniform and they were mostly in shades of blue and business suits. August 28<sup>th</sup>…I am down on my knees on Balbo Street. Gas in my lungs and eyes and mouth. When I fight for vision, I am facing stopped traffic and a mother perched behind the oversized steering wheel of a Camaro. I feel like a fool, on my knees. But I see others gasping and stumbling. I am asked if everything is okay. I ask one girl if I can help. No, she says, no one, nothing can help. I run to a fountain across from the Sheraton-Blackstone and dip my flaming head into the water. I have chosen sides. </p>  <p>August 1968 was our introduction to higher politics, our tour of the military-industrial complex that we had heard so much about from people like L. Mendel Rivers. We did not come to Chicago so much because we had specific plans in mind, but because we sensed something was going to collapse, somehow our worst suspicions about the country were going to be confirmed. </p>  <p>On Saturday, the 24<sup>th</sup>, Lincoln Park was filling with hips, yips, and others who hadn’t decided on a name. An old man, a newspaper wedged between his arm and his side, walked slowly among the figures, smiling, perhaps feeling some affinity for us as he strolled through the park. I was to imagine these seeming polar sympathies throughout the week. Old men minding their business were transformed into compatriots who felt as disenfranchised as we did. Crumpled dowagers on Michigan Avenue, by virtue of their loneliness, became radical sympathizers. Later, at Harvard, I even began to sympathize with a few cops as I looked in their faces; or rather I imagined that they were, deep within, on our side. In Chicago, newly indoctrinated into active radicalism, the cops were the menacing villains. Certainly, I saw behind the corrupt convention to a corrupt system and behind Chicago I discovered a dozen other cities that were going to fall, but I didn’t really see behind the cops. To me they were not just the agents of a power elite, but the members of it to. I couldn’t disassociate their jobs (busting our heads) from themselves as people (often victims of their employer, the state.) At Harvard, however, I was not afraid of them. In fact, I felt pity for them. Brought in by a university president to do a job, they had very little insight into the nature of the battle they were commissioned to fight. In many respects, they were being used to fight their own class interest. I only saw Pusey’s face beneath their helmets. When someone would yell to a cop, “Why are you doing this to us?’, he couldn’t answer. At one point, I wanted to take one cop aside to ask him how hard he had cried at his fathers’ funeral. I wanted to return to him some of the humanity he renounced every time he touched a student with his club. </p>  <p>       In reality, though, the Great Polarization had begun. Dowagers with their manic lipstick were not even impartial observers; they would send in congratulatory letters to Daley and Pusey, as if daughters had just been married. At Harvard, moderates, in their own frustrating way, supported the strike yet often obfuscated the issues. Professors whose courses endeared us turned against the politics their lectures had helped to develop. </p>  <p>“…but don’t put Vaseline on <i>after</i> you’ve been gassed,” the polo-shirted girl said to the marshals sitting on an embankment in the park. “Back injuries? Don’t touch the injured man…keep a wet towel in a Baggie, you can put it over your mouth if you get gassed or Maced.”</p>  <p>Inside the brick house at the top of an embankment, five or six old men played cards in the large barren anteroom. They huddled around a dank folding card table while a fan droned over the doorway. They had been playing there for years and they played on through the <i>washoi </i>maneuvers, the preparation, and the good vibrations in Lincoln Park, their dark rumpled sportscoats well defined against the cream and light grey wall. During this past summer, I passed by the brick house again, and they were playing for the weather was warm. </p>  <p>Spare dope? Spare change? Spare tire? We are in great need of many things. </p>    <p><strong>Late </strong>in the afternoon, a black family needed a short-center fielder and asked a white hip-yip to play in their softball game. Though I was wrong, at the time it looked like it might be the most important thing that happened all day. </p>  <p>            On Sunday night, the evening of the first large-scale police raid in the park, over three thousand milled on the grass, talking idly with reporters and mincing in front of photographers. “You can’t take pictures in this darkness without a flash, Howie,” a newsman said. </p>  <p>            At ten-fifty, some hippies raised a home-made Viet Cong flag amidst a clot of people on the edge of the park. A TV arc light hit them instantly at the cameras began to hum. By eleven forty-five, five thousand of us were in the streets. A small sweep by the cops started up North Avenue and turned down Wells. We started to run away, but a marshal cried quickly, “Walk slow! Walk slow!” I turned and walked slowly down Wells to my brother’s apartment and fell asleep. </p>  <p>            Earlier, on Sunday afternoon, the movement proved it could embrace almost anybody: High school girls, apostate liberals, wing-tipped clerks on their lunch break. “The pigs are disturbing my peace,” a boy who wore Vitalis complained to a group sitting cross-legged on the lawn. “When I buy marijuana, they stop me and that’s disturbing my peace, because grass is my peace. We should tie them down and force a reefer down their throats and then they’ll know what life is. Hey,” he said after a pause, “I want to write for you too. Listen, I can’t go home, cause that’s the Chicago State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. I put my trust in you guys. Really.” </p>    <p><strong>On</strong> Wednesday, August 28, at 2:30, the day of the proposed march to the impenetrable Amphitheatre, the gas hit me even before I crossed Clark Street on the North Side. The tear gas which had been used the night before still hung heavily in the air and as I stepped off the curb, my eyes began to tear and burn. I turned back. Across Clark, an elderly man was about to walk into the invisible field of vestigial gas. As he entered it, he suddenly started to rub his eyes vigorously, glancing about him. After a moment of bewildered posturing, he walked on. The next performance involved a woman who, as the gas hit her, spun around sharply as though she had been pinched on the ass. I tried to cross the street once again but couldn’t and retreated to the rarer atmosphere of the curb. I sat down next to two small black kids and pulled a cold plum out of a bag of fruit I was carrying and pressed it to my irritated eyelids. I sneezed violently. “Whatcha doing?” smiled one of the kids. “You putting plums on your eyes?” </p>  <p>            That afternoon, I met my first cop. After a long wait by Grant Park for the negotiations with the police officials to end and the march to the Amphitheatre to begin, my friends and I walked across the bridge to Michigan Avenue for some dinner. We walked up to the door of what turned out to be the Sheraton-Blackstone Hotel Coffee Shop. Inside, I could see black-aproned waitresses moving about tables peopled with delegates and businessmen. A fat, unctuous cop stood at the door. Ignoring him, I walked up to the revolving doors. The cop put his hand on my chest. </p>  <p>            “Where do you think you’re going, fella?” he intoned. </p>  <p>            “We want to go inside and eat,” I said, too afraid to be sarcastic. </p>  <p>            “Go away.” He drummed his stick in his hands. “Go on, get out of here. You’re all faggots anyway.” </p>  <p>            “Look,” I said, regaining courage. “All we want is some dinner.” </p>  <p>            He moved fully in front of me. “I said to get out of here, you faggots. Understand?” It was like a movie. “C’mon, you faggots.” Oddly, I wore relatively short hair, a Marshall Fields shirt and socks. “We got jails for guys like you.” As we moved away, I heard him laughing behind us. After that, the word ‘pig’ became part of my vocabulary. </p>  <p><strong>At</strong> a cocktail party Thursday afternoon in the Conrad Hilton, Senator George McGovern stood at a window overlooking Michigan Avenue. “Until last night,” he said, “I was inclined to dismiss police brutality as exaggerated. But last night, when I looked out this window, I realized the stories were true.” </p><p><br></p>  <p><i><em>As you know, I have had the reputation for not going out a great deal. My reaction to last night makes it clear that I must go out more often and be more involved…in what are obviously troubled times…What we saw was I’m afraid a very uptight establishment literally goading people…hitting people who had no reason to be hit…Last night, I saw so-called Law and Order, without any consideration for justice or democracy. That doesn’t separate us very far from totalitarian society.</em> </i></p>  <p><i>Hugh M. Hefner</i></p><p><i><br></i></p>  <p><strong>III</strong></p>  <p><strong>What</strong> we learned at Harvard is that it can happen and might happen anywhere—at a university, on your favorite street, to your best friend, at weddings and grand openings. Aside from the Great Discoveries we made about our school and its complicity not only with the war effort, but with the American way of somehow destroying all the good things this country is supposed to stand for, we discovered that nothing is really safe. There is no sanctuary. At Chicago, we were attending a demonstration; it was their turf. But Harvard was like watching a murder take place in your own home. There is hardly any place to hide from a government that will neither accept or even listen to criticism. </p>  <p>            I think of Matthew Arnold’s idea of criticism: “Simply to know the best that is known and thought in the world and, by in turn making this known, to create a new current of true and fresh ideas.” Obviously, the system is not without its critics. It is that the power elite in this country, attuned only to their own voices, will not listen to them. No new currents are created because people cannot reach their government. (The essence of participatory democracy is that certain people, recognizing the inefficiency of representative government, now want to directly control decisions that effect them by being their own representatives.) In traditional democratic theory, the will of the people is synonymous with the will of the state. Yet, there is a depressing homogeneity among politicians and the tendencies of their politics while the will of the people changes rapidly. Despite the fact that government offices are periodically vacated, one tends to regard Johnson and Nixon, Rusk and Rogers as the slightest modification of a grim theme. They touch history only in the sense that they are totally subservient to it; for them, events become unmanageable and the war becomes more important and more powerful than man’s power to stop it. So we are stuck with the same war year after year like a musical which, although it bombed in New Haven, persists in playing to an empty house. Really, none of us are even watching it, none of us will ever play a part. </p>  <p>            And while the government carries out its dubious functions, our new currents run beneath it, unattended. If our “new currents” were simply a stream of radical political thought and activity, the conflict between generations today could be easily characterized as a recurring political phenomenon. But, it is much more than that; our confrontation is more than a starkly political one which demands an end to the war, to racism, and other perversion of democracy. The revolution is much broader and deeper because it is confronting American Culture too. In their own respective historic contexts, radical political confrontations have always occurred. In the Twentieth Century alone, American democracy has been challenged from the left by Wobblies, the Communist Party, and assorted socialists. The present New Left is another episode in the history. Unlike the others, though, it will persevere, not on the strength of the <i>cultural </i>alternative the Movement offers. </p>  <p>            If we define culture as a society’s or nation’s “ways of life,” politics is one of those “ways.” Politics, just like other “ways” such as social norms and economic life, is performed within the context of the culture and assumes its character not only from the particular form of government it attempts to support, but from the way we eat our breakfast, act when we greet people on the street, and handle our personal budgets. The thrust of the Movement is not toward politics alone; the Movement has also emerged as a new way of dress, of conversation, of art, of life-style. We do not see politics as a disease—we see, in a much broader sense that our culture is a disease, a set of reprehensible ways of life, and politics is one of those symptoms. It is primarily a cultural revolution which feeds on a tradition and set of values more alien to the establishment than is our radical politics. The inexorable influence of the Beats, the Beatles, acid rock, Dr. Spock, being the first suburban sons and daughters, and the revival of a sense of the absurd in art are more foreign to the older generation than the radical politics which they once saw before in a different form. But our near-solipsistic, haughty view of culture recalls, if anything, only the Dadaists of the early Twentieth Century in Europe. Is not this following characterization of the Dadaist an apt description in many ways of how we treat the art we create and how we deal with an unsensitized world? : </p><p><br></p>  <p><i>Art is separate from life; the artist is independent of the world and superior to the lifelings…Once the artist had come to be regarded as a being set apart from the world of ordinary men, it followed that his aloofness would be increasingly emphasized…Art would come to be treated as a self-sustaining entity…No longer having to communicate with a public, it would become more opaque. It would be freed from elements extraneous to itself, and particularly from logic and meaning, statistics and exhortation. [The artist] would be proud, disdainful toward the family duties and the law of the tribe…</i></p>  <p><i></i>Malcolm Cowley, <i>Exiles Return </i></p><p><i><br></i></p>    <p><strong>Yet </strong>our Movement has added something still: Willfully divorced from the general public, it appeals nonetheless to a small but broad cross-section of Americans. If this cultural revolution is indeed sheltering artists as well as politicoes, gaining the sincere sympathy of some adults as well as prepubescent highschoolers, then it isn’t going to be killed by an end to the war or conciliatory political adjustments. It is not going to be killed by anti-riot legislation because the bulk of the protest is more subtle than open conflict. A growing disenchantment with this country among SDSers as well as Young Americans for Freedom, among a handful of senators and a small number of responsible administrators tells us that someday the present system is not going to make it anymore. </p>  <p>            This Movement transcends politics and will not die out, I pray, but will create a new culture in two or three generations. The Movement will have succeeded only when universities stop destroying the homes of working class families for their own aggrandizement, when high rises are no longer built in the country, when sea lions are not killed off the coast of California by oil companies, when girls can have sparkling smiles because they have sparkling smiles and not because they use McClean’s, when we stop lying to each other and stop listening to one another’s lies. If our government had not been able to lie to us about the true nature of democracy, they could not have perpetrated an obscene war despite our outcries. If they had found we would not succumb to lies about the war and its “imminent” success, the army could not have lied to the farmers in Idaho when they killed 6000 sheep testing lethal gases. If we had not for so long believed that personal freedoms were ours, the government would not have been able to pass off false freedoms as real ones. But we have not all learned, and many of us do believe now that the troops are coming home. </p>    <p><strong>If</strong> we consider the Rev as a cultural insurrection, then the more doctrinaire, intensely political factions like the Progressive Labor Party become a hindrance as their enforced policies of conformity in political line and dress and their disapproval of Black nationalism contradict the libertarianism of some factions of SDS and young cultural radicals everywhere. There are few things more impervious to revolution in this country than our political structure, because we are not in control of our political destiny at all. If we comprise our entire revolution of blunt demands for political power and change, our protests will only be met with a more than equivalent amount of violence and repression. But our culture is in our hands because we are part of it and by waging a cultural struggle by occupying buildings to save lives and music, we may encounter less resistance. </p>  <p>            What cultural radicals are revolting against, then, is clearly not a specific political institution. What we protest, after we have wept over the killings in Asia and in our own country, is the way of life that not only engenders Presidents like Johnson and Nixon, but creates the people who vote them into office. The conservatively-dressed man on the elevator riding up to his desk job for a business firm attracts our attention because the thought of an alternate conception of life has probably not occurred to him. His dress is a uniform for the technocracy, as if wearing three piece suits is an occupational imperative. We protest a society which exerts the subtle pressure to dress and act a certain way if you make your living a certain way and which condemns a man for wearing no clothes at all or for using a four-letter word when a more polite one would suffice. </p>    <p><strong>I am</strong> perplexed by the recurrent liberal accusation: “But you revolutionaries only want to destroy. You don’t have any programs or specific suggestions.” First, this presupposes that all young radicals are politically committed when even the most political radical thought is tinged by concern for social reform and a cultural reassessment of America. And you cannot destroy culture. Culture is the sum total of all our attitudes and norms, no matter what they are. And if the accusation is a valid political one, it still appears that the occupation of a university building does not precipitate destruction, but change. Haven’t the present condition of the blacks and the intransigence of administrators in the face of student petitions and peaceful demonstrations proved that change is no longer a question of verbal persuasion? Unfortunately, buildings must be occupied because it is now apparent that only an affirmation of physical strength succeeds in an ideological skirmish. A government which believes the key to world peace is half a million troops in Vietnam can only be expected to understand just that same principle of physical presence on domestic issues. The so-called peaceful channels have been tried, but even in those waters there are sharks. </p><p><br></p>    <p><strong>IV</strong></p>  <p><i>“To the left and to the right…”</i></p>  <p><strong>Where</strong> are we going? To begin with, we are going to learn how to live a little better. During the strike at Harvard, we learned that life and love are not always potential energies. Those who supported the strike as a political tactic, and even those who supported it because spring had invaded the Yard, learned how to make love to themselves, to each other, to their dreams, to their temporary freedom, to silk screens, to nurture and make love to the proposition that sometimes we get to pull our own triggers. </p>  <p>            Education in this country is a curious medium. It reveals to the student in its course the infinite possibility for creation and knowledge, but escorts him into a society which often defies us to aspire. More than ever, we are feeling our capacity for brilliance in many fields, but we increasingly realize how useless many of our talents will be in a world controlled by others. Many understand this paradox now. Others of us, seduced by our own creativity and particular vision, will see too late that we will not always be honored for our dreams and talents. At the same time they educate us, they inculcate us into a system which restricts our power to change with its power to repress. They give us knowledge, but deny us its real application; they get us hot, then they take away our women. </p>  <p>            Almost more than anything our estrangement from our university education draws us together. We find ourselves in great and dissatisfied numbers on many campuses. Yet there is paradox inherent in the Movement: Despite all the common bonds, we are not as much an alienated generation as a generation of alienated individuals. As such, each of us has his own solutions and his own ego trips. We are not so much a generation of coherent protestors as we are radicals easily mobilized by issues on which we take a common stand. At times, we are even alienated from each other. Certain factions have just as much difficulty reconciling themselves with fellow radicals as they do with the establishment to which they are opposed. Progressive Labor’s grim-faced revolution, for instance, sometimes frightens me as much as the Harvard administration. Both condemned the joy of music in Harvard Yard. </p>  <p>            October, 1969…two weeks ago, the Vietnam Moratorium came and went in Boston, under blue skies sprinkled with disappointing speeches. Despite its dimensions, the Moratorium often appeared devoid of crucial political power. Whereas before we were cutting niches in the left and right sides, the top and bottom of American politics, we had now momentarily converged in the soft center. Fortunately, recent movies and a growing, heartwarming “divisiveness,” among many other things, prove that our cultural imprint is deepening. SDS may die, but Jack Kerouac lives on. Don’t worry, we can make it happen. You can do it. I can do it. He can do it. Everybody can do it. Just don’t get too tight. </p></p>
