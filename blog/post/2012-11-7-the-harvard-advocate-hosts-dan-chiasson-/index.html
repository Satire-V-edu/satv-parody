    <article>
        <p><p><a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/audience.jpg"><img alt="" height="433" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/audience.jpg?w=622&amp;h=433" title="Audience" width="622"/></a></p><p><em>On Saturday, November 3, Dan Chiasson and David Ferry read from their poetry and answered audience questions at the Advocate building on 21 South Street. The following is an event reflection by Advocate</em> <em>poetry board </em><em>member, Kevin Hong ’15. </em></p><p>“I actually died six weeks ago,” David Ferry said at lunch.</p><p>We were sharing a combination platter at Café Algiers—Ferry, Dan Chiasson, and members of <i>The Devil's Advocate</i>. Ferry explained that his heart had stopped for a minute at a Brookline restaurant before a doctor resuscitated him. Chiasson’s brow furrowed and his eyes softened as Ferry went on: he returned to the restaurant to find out the name of the person who had saved him, and having obtained a name, wrote a “heartrendingly beautiful” letter to the man. (“Longhand?” Chiasson asked, impressed. Ferry is vivacious but admits to his physical frailty.)</p><p>“But they gave me the wrong name!” Ferry said. Chiasson covered his reddening face in his hands and laughed.</p><p>There was a certain warmth between the two poets, arising from years of mutual interest and understanding. Chiasson’s second book, <em>Natural History</em>, is intended to be in dialogue with Ferry’s translations of Horace. Ferry has touted Chiasson’s critical essays, admiring his close attention to both line and sentence. At the reading, Ferry joked, “I’m so glad to finally have the chance to read with my former roommate,” and Chiasson flashed his Amherst College belt.</p><p><span id="more-205"></span></p><p>Remarkable similarities link these men: both went to Amherst, both received graduate degrees at Harvard University, and both taught at Wellesley College (Chiasson is now associate professor there, and Ferry is a professor emeritus). Chiasson published in the <i>Advocate</i> in 2011<sup>,</sup> while Ferry’s poem had appeared in the <em>Advocate</em> back in 1957<sup>.</sup> Both, on Saturday, November 3, rekindled their relationships with 21 South Street.</p><p>Ferry delivered his roommate punch line and Chiasson bent over double. I’ll remember that image. In my mind, David Ferry has acquired the mythic status that his own work explores: Ferry’s brief foray into the underworld echoes Orpheus’s engagement with hell, a frequent subject in Ferry’s most recent book, <em>Bewilderment</em>.</p><p>“I bring no messages from the underworld,” he said at lunch.</p><p>While Ferry’s poetry looks ahead and below into the abyss, Chiasson’s looks back towards his own childhood. Chiasson read from the manuscript of his upcoming book, <em>Bicentennial</em>. The title is taken from the 1976 celebration of America’s birthday, which Chiasson recalls with the cool remove characteristic of his verse. His distant voice is most effective in poems about his father, whom he never knew. The poems are littered with what little knowledge the poet could gather up from his father’s obituaries. In “One on One,” Chiasson reflects on their relationships’ core of absence:</p><p><em>I thought we had agreed to play. I thought you said<br/>
We’d play and play all day, beating and being beaten,<br/>
Taking turns at losing learning its advantages</em></p><p><em>for a young man’s character, then changing fates.<br/>
What kind of game is this, your going away forever,<br/>
sending word, years later, that you’d died?</em></p><p>Chiasson’s verse creates an absence that belies a repressed bitterness and a nostalgia for things past—for the final absence. The bemused and slightly affected speaker reveals his continual bewilderment. His colloquial tone, through repetition and subtle wordplay, slowly gathers momentum before leaping into a higher emotional register. In “Star Catcher,” Chiasson laments the innocent ecstasy of childhood that is at once wonderful and inane:</p><p><em>The logic of loss, we could all understand:<br/>
Every fan trusts that losing is barter.<br/>
Though we wanted to die when the Yankees won,</em></p><p><em>We knew that all losers eventually win,<br/>
Every drowned brother results in another:<br/>
As the plane goes, so goes Thurman Munson.</em></p><p><a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dan.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-207" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dan.jpg?w=670&amp;h=1006" title="Dan"/></a></p><p>The younger poet’s cool and composed reading is in many ways diametrically opposed to that of Ferry, who followed Chiasson with a group of poems from <em>Bewilderment</em>. Chiasson engaged with his audience with poise and detachment. Ferry’s words are an affective plea for understanding:</p><p><em>Among the living the body can do so sometimes,</em><br/>
<em>But the mind, constricted, inhibited by its ancestral</em><br/>
<em>Knowledge of final separation, holds back,</em><br/>
<em>Unable to complete what it wanted to say.</em></p><p><em>What is your name that I can call you by?</em></p><p>– “Resemblance”</p><p><a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/david.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-208" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/david.jpg?w=670&amp;h=714" title="David"/></a></p><p>Kay Ryan has said that if you put an ice cube on your palm, your palm turns pink because the chill attracts your blood. Poetry functions in the same way: its chill brings a reader’s emotions to the surface. Dan Chiasson may practice these poetics of restraint, but Ferry does not subscribe to the same school. It was clear, as I watched him read, that he was possessed and enlivened by his verse. The poet’s voice was insistent and vigorous. Fear, confusion, and love were made palpable in the poet’s unshakeable lines.</p><p>In <em>Bewilderment</em>, Ferry acknowledges his age and puts his feelers out into the unknown. He probes the spaces between human beings and the void of loss. Like torches in a cave, his lines burn brightly, providing what little light he has in his search for the divine, his confrontation of “the big joke.” And in Ferry there is always room for humor: in “Found Single-line Poems,” he inserts the subtitle, “Playing With My Self.”</p><p><a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dandavid1.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-216" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dandavid1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=476" title="DanDavid"/></a></p><p>I left the building last Saturday invigorated and a little dazed by these two very different poets from two generations: one looking back and one looking beyond, one cool and one warm, one who references his childhood as a lost time, and one who invokes classical mythology to recover lost time. Dan Chiasson and David Ferry, after the reading, did agree on one notion evoked in Ferry’s poem, “Brunswick, Maine, Early Winter, 2000″:</p><p>“It is a connoisseurship of the word;<br/>
Philology is that venerable art</p><p>That asks one thing above all other things:<br/>
Read slowly, slowly. It is a goldsmith’s art,</p><p>Looking before and after, cautiously;<br/>
Considering; reconsidering;</p><p>Studying with delicate eyes and fingers;<br/>
It does not easily get anything done.”</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
