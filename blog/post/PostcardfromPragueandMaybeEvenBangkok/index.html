    <article>
        <p><p>A towering archway straddles the cobbled artery that leads to Prague's Old Town Square. It's stoic and unyielding, and it announces that you are entering a district that is Very Old and Very Czech. With bated breath, the main street scurries past a fleet of picturesque buildings, exhaling grandly onto the bustling plaza. From the last week of November to the first week of January, the plaza is home to Prague’s Christmas Market, a sugar-dusted precinct of holiday spirit so idyllic that even the Christian Right could not shake a fist to it. (Baroque church spires loom vigilantly over the smorgasbord of tinsel and chocolate—it’s the kind of capitalism that Our White Lord Jesus Christ would have been okay with.)</p><p>The businesses that orbit the square—sitting pleasantly along the main street and its neighbors—cling to a similar Old World charm. The district is home to quaint bakeries and stores selling Bohemian garnet jewelry, with requisite souvenir shops peppered in between. The echo of boots on cobblestone assures you that your expensive plane ticket truly transported you Elsewhere, but there exist numerous outcroppings for the average American tourist to grab onto, white-knuckled, when the smell of cabbage and consonant-riddled tongue prove too much to bear. A wax sculpture of Bruce Willis posing in the window of a Madame Tussaud’s franchise. A <em>Minions</em> snow globe. An illustrated menu, rendered in cloudless blue English. That the neighborhood most frequented by tourists exists to make Americans comfortable is not shocking to me. What takes me by surprise is the area’s plentiful spread of Thai massage parlors.</p><p>My dad and I count three on one street alone—and when I say “Thai massage parlors,” I don’t mean generic spa businesses that happen to be staffed by Southeast Asian women. I mean that each establishment boldly proclaims that its MASSAGES are THAI. The salons are somewhat uniform in their decor; they forgo the usual cooing whites and blues and opt for screaming shades of absinthe green. One storefront features a digital display: a rapid-fire montage of clients in soothed repose, followed by a boldfaced price that spirals violently onto the screen. 9.99 €! If numbers and currency signs could be written in capitals, these would be. Just looking at all of it makes my blood pressure spike. I am not having a good time. I am not relaxed. Maybe I need a massage. </p><p>Why does the tourist district of Prague harbor such an insatiable demand for THAI MASSAGES specifically? I grasp for analogues—the chicken tikka masala that appears on the menu of every London pub, maybe, or the plethora of Indonesian restaurants in Amsterdam—but no imperial history comes to mind. Although its neighbors were once holdings of the French and British, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country to have never been colonized by Europeans. According to Wikipedia, the largest Asian immigrant population in the Czech Republic hails from Vietnam. Although massage is a medical discipline in Thailand, a generic, non-medicinal practice of the trade has become popular in various European countries since the 1990’s. My cursory Google investigation does little to inform me why <em>three</em> Thai massage salons compete for business on a single street in Prague. </p><p>There is, of course, a lascivious scent to the lucrative massage business, and the wink-nudge assumptions that always seem to accompany young Asian women in service jobs. (What's vacation, after all, without internalized biases?) An expert at praguemassage.net informs me that the many of the city’s salons offer “happy ending massages,” although most businesses on the tourist path are only good for an “unsatisfying rubdown." Every Man, he insists, Should Know THIS About Praha Massage Parlours. </p><p>Still, some of the parlors glow with thinly-veiled lewdness. Prostitution is legal in Prague unless it's organized. With leggy mannequins sprawling under colored neon signs, the windows of the salons recall those that line Amsterdam’s Red Light District. Thai Paradise, a second-story establishment, indulges the voyeuristic urges of the passerby. From street level, you can look up and see clients shin-deep in tanks of pedicure fish, relaxing as the hungry little swimmers devour the dead skin on their feet. (It’s worth noting that the “doctor fish” spa treatment did not originate in Thailand.) </p><p>The visceral garishness of it all wouldn’t be out of place in Amsterdam or Las Vegas or a flaming convertible barreling toward Flavortown, U.S.A. (You are bound and gagged in the passenger seat. Guy Fieri cackles from behind the wheel. Rascal Flatts's “Life is a Highway” is playing, and NOT in a fun, nostalgic way.) But we’re in <em>Prague</em>, as the glass and porcelain wares of neighboring shops insist. On a solitary walk through the neighborhood, I make a stop at Thai Paradise. I am greeted by a man dressed in a conical Chinese farmer’s hat, a neon green silk robe, and, bizarrely, a Shrek mask. My favorite Scottish-accented ogre ushers me into the red-carpeted, Buddha-laden building. Plastic lotus flowers line the staircase. He invites me to luxuriate in his Oriental swamp.</p><p>Upstairs, it’s quiet. The clients are not horny bachelors looking for massages of the wink-nudge variety. A young woman sips tea on the couch while another pays at the counter. The young women working at the reception desk are blonde-haired and blue-eyed, dressed in clingy red velvet outfits with white fur trim: Santa Claus costumes pulled straight out of the <em>Mean Girls</em> talent show. It’s January 3rd. Even Thai Paradise, which does not seem to yield to any cultural or national boundaries, cannot resist Prague’s extended holiday season. The <em>Minions</em> snowglobes and Bruce Willis sculpture cater obviously to the displaced American—to whom does this technicolored, vaguely Pan-Asian, Christmas-observant, seemingly atemporal space speak? I trod wearily down the staircase, stepping into the sunken spots of carpet that have met many feet before mine.</p></p>
