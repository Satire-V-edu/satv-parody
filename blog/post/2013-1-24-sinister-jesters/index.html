        <p><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 417px"><img alt="" height="402" src="http://www.full-stop.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cats-cradle-4.png" width="407"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.full-stop.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.full-stop.net</a></em></p></div><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.full-stop.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.full-stop.net</a></em></p><p>In the Bokonon religion of Kurt Vonnegut’s <i>Cat’s Cradle</i>, “humanity is organized into teams.” Such a team is called a <i>karass</i> and, unlike other groups to which someone belongs—a university, country, family—a person’s <i>karass</i> is rarely perceptible, even to himself. Rather than a shared place or characteristic, one’s <i>karass</i> pivots around a <i>wampeter</i>, a unifying theme or purpose. As I understand it, <i>karass</i>es exist in something like <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>’s “fourth-dimension,” where truths invisible to us three-dimensioned Earthlings become apparent.</p><p>Reading <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> this winter, I was struck by its resemblance to David Foster Wallace’s <i>Infinite Jest</i>. My curiosity grew when I could find almost no evidence that Wallace had recognized Vonnegut’s influence (please correct me if you can). The unacknowledged resemblance dares me to take a leap of Bokononist faith and propose that the two authors, unbeknownst to them, might have belonged to the same <i>karass.</i></p><p><i><span id="more-500"></span></i></p><p>In a minor parallel, both writers have posthumously returned to the bookstores in the past year—Kurt Vonnegut with his recently published collection of letters, and David Foster Wallace with <i>Both Flesh and Not</i>. In a review of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/kurt-vonneguts-letters.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Kurt Vonnegut: Letters</a>, Kurt Andersen identifies an affinity between Vonnegut and Wallace in their respective suicide attempts, Wallace’s devastatingly successful. While Vonnegut did not die in 1984 when he tried to take his own life, he did in 2007, a year before Wallace’s attempt succeeded. Andersen describes Wallace as Vonnegut’s descendant, the “younger generation’s depressed and singular countercultural literary superstar.”</p><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 385px"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://splitsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/davidfosterwallace.jpg" width="375"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>David Foster Wallace, an unknowing descendant of Kurt Vonnegut? Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.splitsider.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.splitsider.com</a></em></p></div><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>David Foster Wallace, an unknowing descendant of Kurt Vonnegut? Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.splitsider.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.splitsider.com</a></em></p><p>While David Foster Wallace and Kurt Vonnegut may well be literary relatives, their <i>wampeter</i> runs deeper than a bond of depression and countercultural achievement. It is worth noting some broad correspondences between <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> and <i>Infinite Jest</i>, both of which take place in the brief calm after an apocalyptic storm—Vonnegut’s, historical; Wallace’s, futuristic. <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> is set after the bombing of Hiroshima; <i>Infinite Jest</i>, after an event that leaves much of Canada and some of North America (now “O.N.A.N”) a toxic wasteland. In addition to these global cataclysms, both novels are preceded by deaths of a smaller scale. Before <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> begins, Felix Hoenikker, the inventor of the atomic bomb and ice-nine—a chemical that freezes you dead at first touch—dies from his latter invention. He leaves his children, Angela, Frank and Newt (a dwarf), bereft of their enigmatic and fatally creative father. Before <i>Infinite Jest</i> begins, James Orin Incandenza, a prolific filmmaker whose repertoire included “Infinite Jest”—a motion picture that leaves you dead at first viewing—blows himself up in a jerry-rigged microwave. His leaves his children, Hal, Orin and Mario (a dwarf), bereft of their enigmatic and fatally creative father.</p><p><i>Cat’s Cradle</i> and <i>Infinite Jest</i> also feature spiritual gurus (Bokonon; Lyle), superlatively beautiful women (Mona Aamos Monzano; Joelle) and invented vocabularies (Vonnegut designs terminology for Bokononism; Wallace churns out anagrams to typify his futuristic, subsidized America).</p><p>What unites Vonnegut and Wallace in my mind, however, is not <i>what</i> they wrote about (eerily similar though it may be) but <i>how</i> they wrote it. Both writers, despite their dark biographies and fictional landscapes, succeeded in portraying the grim and bleak with humor and humanity. D. T. Max quotes David Foster Wallace in his <i>New Yorker</i> article, “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/09/090309fa_fact_max?currentPage=2" target="_blank">The Unfinished</a>”: “Really good fiction could have as dark a worldview as it wished, but it’d find a way both to depict this world and to illuminate the possibilities for being alive and human in it.” Vonnegut may have been more expressive of his pessimism than Wallace; indeed it was Vonnegut who <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/04/kurt-vonneguts-8-tips-on-how-to-write-a-great-story/255401/" target="_blank">instructed the aspiring writer</a> to “make awful things happen” to his story’s characters, and Vonnegut’s own life—marked by his mother’s suicide on Mother’s Day in 1944 and his witnessing of the bombing of Dresden a year later— seems at times as though it were plotted with this instruction in mind. Like Wallace, however, Vonnegut wielded an unerring sense of humor; with this, he, too, illuminated within a world however bleak “the possibilities for being alive and human.”</p><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 260px"><img alt="" height="203" src="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/images/Vonnegut4.jpg" width="250"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Both Vonnegut and Wallace find the humor in the grim. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laphamsquarterly.org</a></em></p></div><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Both Vonnegut and Wallace find the humor in the grim. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laphamsquarterly.org</a></em></p><p>Vonnegut’s and Wallace’s characters treat bluntly and jestingly their own misfortunes, to darkly humorous effect. In Cat’s Cradle, Angela, Newt, and Frank take frequent detours as they recount to the narrator the day they discovered their dead father. Before they found him frozen on the porch, they came across a dishrag that had met the same fate; Newt describes that it “reminded [him] right away of Mother’s reticule, of how the reticule felt,” and Angela “explains sentimentally that when a child, Newt had treasured his mother’s gold reticule.” Yet there is no equivalently sentimental explanation of Newt’s next discovery: that, along with their dog, their “father was stiff, too.” The children and narrator then proceed to confront yet another victim of ice-nine, Papa Monzano, whom they hide in a closet in order to “simplify the tableau” of his hospital room. The humor in the scene, and throughout the novel, lies in the dissonance between subject and description: a dead body is rhetorically added to a dead dishrag and dog, and another is hidden in the closet as an object no more valuable than a man-sized mop.</p><p>This dissonant humor surfaces in <i>Infinite Jest</i> as well, perhaps most strikingly in the scene parallel to that in <i>Cat’s Cradle</i>. Orin calls Hal to discuss their father’s suicide, and Hal is only disturbed by the conversation insofar as it distracts him from his nail- clipping. After revealing that he was the one to find his father’s wrecked body, he proceeds to describe his tactic: “the clippers are poised, blades on either side of the nail.” Later, when he explains the physics of the death, he compares his father’s head to a potato, asking Orin if he has ever “baked a potato in a microwave oven?” and did he know why “you have to cut the potato open before you turn the oven on?”</p><p>For many philosophers, humor is borne of incongruity. According to Schopenhauer, “the cause of laughter in every case is simply the sudden perception of the incongruity between a concept and the real objects which have been thought through it in some relation.” In the scenes I describe, laughter is invoked by precisely this incongruity: the concept of death is intimately related, in both context and association, to such objects as a dishrag, a reticule, a dog, a tableau, nail-clippings, and a baked-potato. The dissonance between weighty actuality and light description is humorous; that those who lightly describe the weighty actuality are those who should be most heavily affected by it, is unsettling. Biographies and plot aside, it is Vonnegut’s and Wallace’s dark sense of humor, their eye for the incongruities in life, for the yang of despair’s yin, that unite the two writers in a formidable <i>karass</i>.</p><p><!--more--></p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
