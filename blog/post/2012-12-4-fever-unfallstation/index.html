        <p><p><a href="http://theadvocateblog.net/2012/12/04/envoy-unfallstation/attachment/1/" rel="attachment wp-att-398"><img alt="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-398" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/1.jpg?w=670"/></a></p><p>You might not know what salivary glands are, or that you have two, one on either side of your face. Put your fingers on the line of your jaw under your ear, and now move them towards your nose a little. What you are touching under the skin — that tough tissue — those are salivary glands.</p><p>I didn’t know I had salivary glands either until I contracted an infection in Berlin that caused them to swell up like hard balloons. My friend got it first; we were having dinner in our small apartment when she lay down on the ground and stopped moving. We didn’t have a thermometer, so all I knew was that her forehead singed my fingers when I touched it, and that her eyes were kind of blank. But we were sixteen, invincible, broke, and living an adventure in a foreign city. We had no guide book, no Internet, and no knowledge of an equivalent to 911 (nor knowledge that 911 works anywhere). So we got in a cab and told the driver <em>Krankenhaus</em>, and he drove us away into the empty Sunday-night city.</p><p><span id="more-397"></span>We pulled up at a deserted alley and the driver gave us a look. My friend’s leg felt like a radiator against mine. I didn’t know the word for ER, so I asked for the “quick room.” The driver only shrugged and repeated the fare.</p><p>This particular hospital in Berlin — I still don’t know its name or where it is in the city — looked like a university campus, or a private mental institution, and on this night at least, all the lights were out. My friend couldn’t walk much, so I left her in one place and ran around in the dark.</p><p>I encountered a strange person as I was running and, though I was not the delirious one, I still have a hard time convincing myself he was real. By this time I had remembered the word for ER and pleaded with him three or four times in German and once in English to tell me where it was. He only looked at me blankly, before mimicking me in a high-pitched squeal. Then he ran away.</p><p>It wasn’t long before I saw the glowing sign that read <em>Unfallstation</em>, an oasis in what had become my madness. I sprinted back to fetch my friend and within minutes we were sitting in front of two hypnotically calm German doctors. By this time her face had swelled up to around one and a half times its normal size, and the doctors sat for a while probing her chipmunk cheeks in silence, the only sound the quiet weeping of an old Turkish woman in the corridor. Eventually they prescribed her a medicine that drained us of our last euros. We spent the entirety of the next day lying in a public park, having been kicked out of our apartment at 9am and unable to afford anything else. Our flight — thank God — was scheduled for late that evening.</p><p>The doctors told us that if she hadn’t come in by sunrise the fever would have killed her.</p><p>A few weeks later the sides of my face expanded as hers had done, and I lay in agony, unable to talk or eat, being tended to by my mother. It was an ugly illness, not only in that it had none of the romance or drama of my friend’s, but also in that my face was distorted in such a way that I couldn’t help but cry any time I accidentally saw my reflection.</p><p>Neither the German doctors nor a string of English ones were able to diagnose what it was that we contracted, and neither the expensive drugs we bought at the night pharmacy in Berlin nor the antibiotics I acquired for free from the National Health Service cured it. It simply faded with time, and I have no assurance that it won’t one day come back. So it is now in my nature to touch my face habitually in a superstitious prayer, haunted by that strange sickness, not quite able to believe it was real.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
