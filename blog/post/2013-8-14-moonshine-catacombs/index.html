Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.panoramio.com/" target="_blank">www.panoramio.com</a></em></p><p>A few hundred feet below the cabs and wheezing busses that circle the rotunda at Denfert-Rochereau, a plaza in a southern neighborhood of Paris, the remains of six million Parisians lie quiet and dense. Wheelbarrows began to transfer the bodies here in the late eighteenth century, the city’s central cemeteries groaning under the weight of their holdings. The bodies were, by then, giving off an odor that had started to seep into the central markets, clinging redolently to the fruit. Here in the so-called catacombs, skeletons from the medieval era rub shoulders with the bones of Robespierre and Marat. Tourists can pay eight euros to wander among the stacked-up skulls.</p><p>These are not the only tunnels sprawling underneath the breadth of Haussmann’s boulevards. People tend to forget that much of the southern part of Paris is constructed on a delicate crust, fault lines slicing just atop a porous mantle. You remember only when there is a collapse, a whole southeastern neighborhood, for instance, that crumbled into its foundations back in the sixties. The tunnels were quarries, at first: it was their stones that built the city when the south was no more than barren land, when builders could cart their materials from here over to the Panthéon and the Louvre. As Paris’s borders were teased outwards, construction overlaid the old quarries, sealing them in like streets under the dried lava of Pompeii. There are almost two-hundred miles of these pathways coursing beneath the urban lanes.</p><p><span id="more-1084"></span></p><p>Of the intrepid pioneers who seek to probe the quarries’ depths, Emilien R. is a typical case. At twenty-three, he is jagged-nosed and tall, with big hands and feet that give him a pieced-together, gangly look. He has just graduated from a prestigious French university, and he’s smart, sharply funny, though if caught at a quiet moment a sort of desperate wild streak might briefly muddy his eyes. It is summertime now and he is not sure what he’ll do next. But tonight he is the leader of an intimate gang of <i>cataphiles</i>, lovers of the catacombs, a term employed more often by the media than by the practitioners themselves. He hands out headlamps, stuffs beers into the backpacks of each friend, and tells the group to follow him. It is nearly eleven o’clock.</p><p>From Denfert-Rochereau it is a short metro ride south-west, then a hike a few blocks north, where Emilien turns and stops. One by one the group members hoist themselves over a fence and ease down a hill to an abandoned train track and tunnel. They walk for what seems like miles into the gaping hollow, until there’s no longer light from behind and none yet from up ahead. Emilien studies a map. He shines his headlamp onto the right-hand side of the tunnel, the faint beam illuminating a small oval hole. Ducking down to crawl through headfirst, he says, “This is it,” and one by one each ducks down after him, emerging into a damp limestone alley barely two meters tall.</p><p>Until 1955, when entering the catacombs was made illegal, they were easier to reach: there were entrances in parks, under staircases, in the basements of the Latin Quarter’s prestigious private schools. During World War II, you sometimes hear, French members of the Résistance used the tunnels as headquarters, as did the German occupiers. Underground battles ensued, perhaps, muffled by the earth above. Or maybe just a truce and quick exchange of cigarettes. Beginning in the sixties, the police began to seal these entrances. Now they are harder to get to and it’s never clear, upon arrival, if they’ll still be open. The police patrol inside, sometimes, handing out tickets, a sixty-five euro fine. This deters some but not others.</p><p>Emilien, for example, comes down here often. He has just begun to bring his girlfriend; he has friends among the Thursday-night regulars. Many are young, college-aged or in their twenties, and remind you of Emilien: a Dean Moriarty type, a kind of intelligence with an itch to escape, burrowing under Paris instead of hurtling across the American plains. You can track down these groups through voices, lights, or someone’s tinny iPhone music. Every so often the winding alleys empty out into a columned cavern, which reveals them, huddled around candles, drinking, hanging out.</p><p>There are slabs of stone in these caverns worn down with decades of use. There are plaques ensconced every so often within the alleyways with names of streets — Rue Dareau, Rue Feuillantine — vague reminders of a time before the passages were ossified below-ground. When it rains, puddles clog the alleys: you can avoid them at first, but are soon slogging through up to a few feet of water (“Don’t wear any clothes you care about,” Emilien tells his guests). If there were a leak or rainstorm the <i>cataphiles</i>’ chances would not look good.</p><p>There is a middle-aged man here, too, a caretaker at the Luxembourg Gardens, who has been coming down for sixteen years. (“How often do you <i>descendre</i>?” they ask each other, “who was here last week when I couldn’t <i>descendre</i>?”) In the seventies, they remind each other, there were real parties, punk raves and neon lights, drugs and music and late-night glee. It was the definitive alternative scene.</p><p>It’s quieted down by now. To <i>descendre, </i>now, is to enter a world stiller and calmer than above. It is an oddly melancholy realm, chilled and damp even on a muggy July night, where you could stay for days and, like the Chilean miners, never know how long you’ve been gone. Where the hours’ strictures lose their urgency, if only for a time; where you can wander and forget, and maybe escape whatever needs escaping, if only for a night. There is no reason to whisper, and yet everyone does — awed, perhaps, and at once sobered and enthralled. Enthralled, at least, until the food runs out and the beer bottles are empty, and you’re cold and wet and ready to return, and you crawl back and out and up into the cobblestoned street in the fourteenth arrondissement, where café-goers look askance at the skinny, sooty teenagers emerging from a manhole, explorers who were out looking for an adventure, perhaps one of the last that can so easily be found.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
