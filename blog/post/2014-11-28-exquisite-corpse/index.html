One dappled banana chopped over a sprinkling of strawberries, coated with a simple-syrup drizzle to brighten the dollop of tang marketed as Greek. It needs ice, and milk, and the employee adds them as I throw a fistful of singles at the register. Nine minutes.</p><p>Across the concourse, four friends wait for a boost of caffeine delivered in 100-calorie gulps. One latté, one cappuccino, one chai, one black coffee. Eight minutes, and the girl in the Pinkberry hat and Pinkberry apron and Pinkberry polo pours the pink slurry into a cup, just for me. 16 oz fills, and at the bottom of the blender there’s that little layer that always tastes best straight from the container, dripping down your jowls as stationary blades rest above your eyes. They should make a special drink, the “extra little bit at the bottom you always wanted but the barista always throws away.” I would buy that.</p><p>Their caffeinated vessels slide out as liquefied strawberry seeds skate between my teeth. Colton, our flax-haired keeper of the tickets, says he always ends up running to catch the bus. One last slurp, and my empty cup enters the trash. Faye sprinkles a delicate pattern of cinnamon on her tall drip.</p><p>I wouldn’t call it a run, more of a series of hyperextended strides from Starbucks to the terminal. The last open seats on the bus separate us into little Harvard islands, and I acclimate to this fate with some Kanye. Colton, however, swaps and barters us into an Advocate enclave hidden in the last two rows. We’re the cool kids in the back, legs up, chatting across the aisle, with prime access to the bathroom. Next stop, New York City.</p><p><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9823-as-smart-object-1.jpg"><img alt="_MG_9823 as Smart Object-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1515" height="446" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9823-as-smart-object-1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=446" width="670"/></a></p><p><b>Reina</b></p><p><b>The Sam Commandments</b></p><p><b>1) Use the word moist</b></p><p><b>2) Write one, incredibly detailed and provocative image of someone eating</b></p><p>The past four years as a list of bus rides from Boston to New York City: The people carted home for Thanksgiving when I was a freshman; riding there and back in love; the lover who pinched my arm down the length of Manhattan, as a form of punishment, because I had done something wrong. Megabus has a moist odor of desire, misery, and expectation. And Wendy’s. It has an odor of Wendy’s, as well.</p><p>I’ve come separately from the rest of them, so I emerge reeling creaky-legged from Mega and cart myself down into the rushandclatter of the subway, following their crumb trail of text messages to the Village, carting myself down and downtown. And here, eventually, they are: Sitting around a table in a dumpling shop, cheeks red from the transition off the street. We do names, because I don’t know them as well as they know each other, and meanwhile Sam is sucking the inside out of a dumpling: his lips to the plump dough, working his tongue into its crevices, sauce dripping down his chin. And my happiness is the happiness of seeing a flash of a friend’s red coat in the subway, a heady espresso-shot of recognition, a familiar clatterandwarmth. So we ask questions, silly at first but growing more and more serious: Would you stay with an otherwise perfect partner if they always referred to themselves in the third person? If they always videotaped you in bed? What if they were more successful than you were? What if you never authored another thing again?</p><p>We walk down the street afterward, linking arms, boots clacking, and because I am the group’s one senior the questions nag at me, get in my belly. The future looms, but in a productive way, maybe: It’s easy to feel like you can weave something when you’ve got so many skilled hands.</p><p><b><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9853-as-smart-object-1.jpg"><img alt="_MG_9853 as Smart Object-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1512" height="446" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9853-as-smart-object-1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=446" width="670"/></a><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9913-as-smart-object-1.jpg"><br/>

<li><b>Write about It’s Great to Live in Harrison Day.</b></li>
</ul><li><b>Write about It’s Great to Live in Harrison Day.</b></li><p>We arrive at the MetroNorth terminal in Grand Central, Track 16, newsstand adjacent, archway opened like the mouth of a seven-year-old expressing ineffable longing for a Fig Newton.</p><p>Departing: MetroNorth, New Haven Line, off-peak, where sleek Armani dress-pants grow wrinkles and skinny girls eat Yoplait messily away from judgmental eyes. The city Cinderellas morph back into suburban pumpkins but the train runs past two; the endless Hudson runs under a black sky to your Westchester parking lot of choice.</p><p>Our choice: Harrison, New York, sister-town to Rye. Two days later its citizens will celebrate It’s Great to Live in Harrison Day, high-school marching bands accompanying town-board hopefuls in striped sashes.</p><p>I am from Cortlandt Manor, sister-town to Rye’s sister-town, so many miles West. Outside it’s too dark to compare suburb-to-suburb particularities, but the interior of Emma’s house looks almost exactly like mine. Or rather, the sense of interiority, of walls that separate kitchen from patio, of snack food in the cupboards, of people who come home at 5:00 on Tuesdays or 2:30 on Thursdays, feels like mine. We stand in the kitchen in two semicircles, eating apple crisp out of glasses with spoons, wrapped in the sorts of blankets one folds over the backs of couches. Someone says that it feels like high school, and we put our spoons in the sink.</p><p>The Harrison Station, in daylight, looks out over a broad expanse of level highway and a Carvel. It is Sunday morning but the train’s nearly full, commuters sleek and flat-clothed again, so we stand between seats, huddled in two semicircles.</p><p><b><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9839-as-smart-object-1.jpg"><img alt="_MG_9839 as Smart Object-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1514" height="446" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9839-as-smart-object-1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=446" width="670"/></a>Colton</b></p><p><b>Maia’s Mandates:</b></p><li><b> Flash back to an embarrassing moment from your youth</b></li><li><b> Include the declaration, “Oh, Reader!”</b></li><p>With a few hours free in the morning, we default to MoMA: somehow the only downtime destination I can ever brainstorm in this city. After reluctantly checking our coats—Oh Reader! Why is MoMA always so knotted with ice? Why so fucking cold?—we’re expedited via parental membership to Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs.</p><p>Within minutes, we’ve separated—not by our preferences for certain works but by pace. Later, my friend will draw a comparison between slow consumption of paintings and food, how both signal the refinement of deep examination. Speed, it seems, is superficial and barbaric, and indeed I’ve always prided myself on slow, contemplative pacing.</p><p>Yet that taste for the slow is far from a personal merit; it’s been bred by a privileged childhood of museum visits and cultural outings. Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu surfaces in my mind, reminding me that aesthetic taste maintains social hierarchy by falsely equating preference with aptitude. Those fortunate enough to be raised with the “correct” preferences maintain a position at the cultural center. It’s hard to teach yourself to slow down. Any self-satisfaction fades away when I realize the cut-outs have merely filtered us by class and geography; pace becomes but a marker for upbringing.</p><p>A child lunges toward a study of Matisse’s Vence Chapel, and I’m brought back to my own infantile rebellions against high-art. As our atheist holiday tradition, my family is sitting up-front at the Nutcracker, and my five-year old self is stuck enduring the ballet’s awful climax: endless rotations of the Sugar Plum Fairy (SPF) and her Cavalier. They dance together, then separately, then once more as a pair—dividing and fusing over and over. My decorum cracks when the SPF surfaces for the third time. “Oh no, not again,” I grumble loudly, and—so I’m told—a knowing smile curls on the SPF’s mouth as my voice wafts over from three rows away. I’ve spoken what she knows and what the cultured audience cannot speak.</p><p>Fifteen years later, I too am conditioned to love the illusion of pacing, to relish and further Bordieu’s ghastly hierarchy of aesthetic distinction—just by moving slowly.</p><p><b><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9913-as-smart-object-1.jpg"><img alt="_MG_9913 as Smart Object-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510" height="1004" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9913-as-smart-object-1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=1004" width="670"/></a>Faye</b></p><p><b>The Code of Colton: </b><b>Give each panelist a bizarre or funny or snarky epithet. When referencing them, try to use the epithet as much as possible.</b></p><p>The guard in front of the Guild Theater tells us to toss our coffee (“No food or drink allowed”) bought from Starbucks five harried minutes ago. I try to gulp. No luck, the liquid burns. I toss my fourth cup today, much more than I normally consume. Apparently New York demands coffee. Stopping for caffeine is a prerequisite to activity, no matter how late you are.</p><p>Once inside the dark auditorium, we hurry to our seats and are immediately treated to an onstage panorama of <i>New Yorker</i> folk: “seasoned” and “celebrated” travel writers (program title: “Hit the Road”). Paul Theroux, in tan jacket and round eyeglasses, looks like Rudyard Kipling and acts like he stepped straight from the savannah, misplacing his rifle and glass of bourbon on the way. Next to him sits Elif Batuman in a belted print dress, whose writing has been called “Helplessly Epigrammatical”. Effusive Gary Shteyngart fiddles in his seat, eyes jittering around in search of the Next Big Joke (NBJ). Dinaw Mengestu, a true Modest Mouse, waits for the program to start. Phil Gourevitch, trying to make himself anonymous, is the Moderator.</p><p>Kipling starts the conversation, claiming he writes his books in three months flat while riding Patagonian trains. Epigrammatic looks terrified at the thought. The NBJ flings something witty on the floor, some bit about checking into a Russian brothel for the elderly. Modest Mouse arches an eyebrow, but Kipling takes the bait and unintentionally asks the NBJ for the address of this fine establishment. The NBJ is gleeful; he grins a cock-a-doodle grin and knows he’s won this round.</p><p>Buzzing in my head intensifies—maybe it’s good I didn’t have that fourth cuppa, or maybe it’s a placebo effect. Moderator intervenes. This panel is becoming too heated, he senses. Moderator tosses a question to Modest Mouse, hoping for a lifesaver. Modest Mouse makes an elegant statement about social responsibility in travel, but the coiffed and collared audience isn’t here for that; they want fictitious blood.</p><p>The NBJ and Kipling scent the audience’s desire and enter an unexpected partnership. They deliver: verbally sparring, the NBJ’s ruffian Jewish-Russian <i>isms </i>take jabs at Kipling’s juicy patrician utterances. Epigrammatic and Modest Mouse, sandwiched between these two typic jousters under hot studio lights, begin to sweat. They sip from water bottles, talk of Russia and Ethiopia and university (they’re not far removed, and quite aware of the fact). Moderator bounces between everyone, trying very hard to remain anonymous.</p><p>All at once the program ends. The NBJ and Kipling lunge at their chains, raring for planes and duty-free cocktails. Epigrammatic and Modest Mouse had a fine time, but are ready to get the heck out of here. The audience steps up to ask questions at the mic. Our group exits the Guild Theater, passing Epigrammatic, who decamps via black car. On the sidewalk, someone mentions coffee (!), but it’s already past three o’ clock and the literary showdown has made us hungry. We decide on sushi. Alaska roll, anyone?</p><p><b><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9978-as-smart-object-1.jpg"><img alt="_MG_9978 as Smart Object-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1509" height="446" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9978-as-smart-object-1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=446" width="670"/></a>Emma</b></p><p><b>Faye’s Fiats: </b><b> Incorporate as many words you would use to describe sushi (a la Jiro Dreams of Sushi) as you can, even when the words are seemingly not appropriate. I.e. you could describe Colton’s hair as a shock of wasabi (okay that’s a bad one, but something like that).</b></p><p>Stomachs a-rumbling. I am charged with the solemn task of locating a sushi restaurant within walking distance of the Director’s Guild of America Theater Complex, and require help from Yelp – that beacon of eaterdom whose logo, I like to think, gestures toward fusion cuisine in its hybridization of Yahoo and Ask Jeeves.</p><p>The app has spoken! Cool as cucumbers, we roll out. Manhattan, this afternoon, is bright as a swath of ginger. We do not zigzag so much as chess knight el our way to the restaurant, heeding, of course, roe-esque red lights. The restaurant is a staid, spacious joint in the lower 40s. I believe we are its sole patrons (it is 4pm: meal barrens) but cannot know for sure because each table is hidden behind a papery, opaque barrier. The six of us (Jeannie, the welcome new addition) turn our attention to the menu. There’s some talk of dissent (Maia, I think, considers a rice bowl) but eventually, happily, all board the a la carte bandwagon.</p><p>Six famished undergrads, six plates of sushi. The rigmarole of dividing rolls occupies us for a minute. Chopstick-calisthenics background our conversation, which quickly veers toward technology: as ubiquitous as white on rice and, frequently, wasabi-like in its overwhelming intensity. Someone postulates that the ease with which technology enables us to duck out of awkward social situations (I’ll just stare at my phone now, thanks) discourages us from overcoming said awkwardness. Someone counters: but technology bolsters our ability to maintain casual friendships; a poke or a post is an efficient way to communicate regard, however remotely.</p><p>The sushi is delicious. Not as sticky as the Lam Caf veggie rolls I’m used to. And we are a cheery party – six edamame beans in a doubly-long pod. Faye, Maia, Jeannie, Colton, Sam (absent Reina too): did you ever know that you’re (all) my Jiro?</p><p><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9891-as-smart-object-1.jpg"><img alt="_MG_9891 as Smart Object-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1511" height="446" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9891-as-smart-object-1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=446" width="670"/></a></p><p><b>Sam</b></p><p><b>Emma’s Edict: </b><b>Add parentheticals, written in the voice of one of your parents, commenting on your writing.</b></p><p>The same strides that slid (how can a stride slide) us before slide us now across the avenues and blocks of New York City. The tickets say when the bus will leave, and my watch (when did you get a watch stop spending my money) says we will be late. Taxis (more $$$) ignore our waving arms until one does not and takes us to Grand Central (you mean the Port Authority), where we run on loud floors until stopping at a line, beginning the 45-minute wait for our 45-minute late bus.</p><p>New York entered my childhood as grandma’s and grandpa’s and mom’s (me) home. They lived “just outside the city,” in a town where their Reform Judaism stuck out like an Orthodox Jew anywhere else.</p><p>New Jersey, always a plane ride away.</p><p>The happiest memory of my entire life (large claim) is from New York (cliché claim). I’m three, or four, a week removed from running out of <i>Hercules</i>, terrified by the pre-millennium CGI imagined Hydra. I walk back in, my dad likes to tell people at Christmas parties (I don’t embarrass you), after an epiphany re: (stop trying to be DFW) conquering your fears of Disney villains.</p><p>The city stretched in every direction of the hotel’s concierge lounge. I can see it over the grey arm of my chair. It looks different upside down, sideways, like the snow globe I’ll buy (I’ll buy) later and shake shake before losing, somewhere.</p><p>Grandpa, the diamond dealer with the toupee, walks over to give me a carton of blueberries. All my earlier memories, of two and three and one, replay mentally with the bland sepia tone of forgotten, unappreciated Instagram pics. These blueberries, I can still see them now, and they’re blue.</p><p>New York would bring me back for grandpa a few more times, then his funeral, grandma’s 80th in the limo, some afternoons chewing ice cream, a college tour, all threaded together by a landing in Newark, followed by a connecting ride to the city along the George Washington Bridge. Vacation in Jersey, spend a day in Manhattan, then return home to palm trees on street corners under the Hollywood sign (a sweet paragraph; however, also unnecessary. delete).</p><p>This is my first time exiting the city on a bus, driving into a state that does not begin with New, without mom to guide me as I push the conversation toward words like “coffee” or “water” (stop it) to hear that thick accent reveal itself. With friends, the lull in conversation drags my eyes to the cobbled walls boxing in the highway and the buildings shrinking into houses until they become nothing for a moment.</p><p>And then the trees begin, and Harvard creeps back into our conversations. MOMA reflections twist into ideas on the Advocate, and throbbing bellies of credit card (!) purchased food throb at the thought of tomorrow’s HUDS. It’s tough to appreciate the weekend when our minds and bodies are both moving back to the place we have to focus on tomorrow; the 36-hour reprieve might just be another gcal (?) blip in between seminars and meetings. Or maybe I’ll remember sitting and talking and listening too, someday, in bright, distinct, blue memories.</p><p>I take a few pictures, and always end up in the reflection on the glass. It’s nighttime, and I can still see New York in all of our smiles (sappy ending; rewrite).</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
