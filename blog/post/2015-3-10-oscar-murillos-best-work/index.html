The highlight of the show, for me, was the chance to directly see the work of a prominent young artist who had previously existed – again, for me – only in the cyber-ether, the 28-year-old Colombian-British painter Oscar Murillo. </span><span id="more-1660"></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Likely no one else in America, outside a small coterie of art world dealers, gallerists, and fairgoers, has seen a Murillo painting before this, either. His solo exhibition at the David Zwirner Gallery last year took the form of a chocolate candy assembly line where 13 Colombian workers produced “Chocomelos” (Mallomars without the biscuit layer) for visitors. If the gesture sounds familiar, that’s because it is. Felix Gonzalez-Torres gave away cellophane-wrapped candy, in <a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/152961"><span class="s2">1991</span></a>; Dieter Roth sculpted chocolate self-portraits in the 1960’s; Janine Antoni gnawed off a 600-lb. block of chocolate in <a href="http://www.artnews.com/2013/02/21/chocolate-self-portraits-by-janine-antoni-and-dieter-rot/"><span class="s2">2001</span></a>, and so forth. Despite the social practice underpinnings of Murillo’s iteration, called <i>A Mercantile Novel, </i>surely it deflated the hopes of a public eager to see the canvases of a man dubbed a “soaring star” at 27, when his canvases were already selling for more than $300,000. ¹</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So it was gratifying to see the paintings incarnate. But aside from an interesting presentation of several of his canvases laid out on the floor for museumgoers to handle up-close, all the paintings themselves betray an acute anxiety of, or at least serious debt to, postwar abstract expressionism. (This bears repeating because of the exhibition titular assertion otherwise.) Murillo’s line seems parodic of Rauschenberg and Twombly, and his much-vaunted painted words echo Basquiat, either a sly update spoofing consumer culture at best, or a clunky mimic at worst. In the present corpus, which includes things like “coconut water” and “yoga,” I lean toward the latter.</span></p><p class="p1"><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/murillo_yoga.jpg"><img alt="murillo_yoga" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1663" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/murillo_yoga.jpg?w=670"/></a></p><p style="text-align:center;"><em>Untitled (la era de la sinceridad), 2013. Silkscreen, oil paint, oil stick, aluminum foil, dirt, and copper. 61 x 41 1/4 inches (155 x 105 cm)</em></p><p class="p1" style="text-align:left;"><span class="s1">Several long and unfocused profiles of Murillo reach for some limpid honorific like “Radiant Child,” as which René Ricard christened Basquiat. But the next Basquiat will not look so… Basquiat. “Bomb style packages itself.” ²</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is remarkable that Murillo’s art still “looks like art” – the supreme criteria for work on the market today – nearly twenty years after this look debuted. </span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">But my misgivings about his painting and inconsistent exhibited content were largely swept aside when I learned of an ingenious performance he recently concluded in Brazil, which was one of the most potent gestures in global art of the last few years. Murillo was invited to a residency, at collector Frances Reynolds’s Rio de Janeiro-area mansion, ending in September 2014. He was struck upon arrival that nearly all the domestic staff were black, and subsequently spent the entire residency wearing a white jumpsuit working alongside them in the house. (Murillo worked for several years as a cleaner to support his wife and son after graduating from art school.) He revealed this fact at a party concluding the residency at the mansion, having hung the dirty jumpsuit outside, and gave a speech in which he “</span><span class="s3">chastised the country for what he perceived to be blatant ‘colonization.’</span><span class="s1">” ³</span></p><p class="p4"><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/72-26-_01_b02_new-betterlight-from-ben.jpg"><img alt="72.26 _01_B02_New BetterLight from Ben" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1661" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/72-26-_01_b02_new-betterlight-from-ben.jpg?w=670"/></a></p><p class="p4" style="text-align:center;"><em>Robert Rauschenberg, Collection, 1954/1955; oil, paper, fabric, wood, and metal on canvas, 80 in. x 96 in. x 3 1/2 in. (203.2 cm x 243.84 cm x 8.89 cm); Collection SFMOMA, Gift of Harry W. and Mary Margaret Anderson; © Robert Rauschenberg Foundation / Licensed by VAGA, New York, NY. San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</em></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">To be a fly in the punch at that party. Murillo apparently brought Reynolds to tears, and was heckled with questions about social practice, Latin American artists, and the market therein. The ArtForum “diary” entry from the evening blithely notes that “</span><span class="s3">guests tried to enjoy the outdoor party after the polemical address, but it wouldn’t be so easy.</span><span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The action itself is poetically forceful, in the Aristotelian sense. I mean, it is intrinsically so elegant that no retelling of it would diminish its impact. Where I had, rightly or wrongly, dismissed Murillo as a willing participant in the gross machinery of art market forces – a young, brown, working-class receptacle for the desires of the [nearly all-white] patrons, gallerists, and curators who desperately want not to miss the “Van Gogh boat” (“the idea of the unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret”) – Murillo revealed an exquisite self-awareness. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The performance fleshes out the mystifying treatment he has received by kingmakers like the prominent art-collecting couple, Don and Mera Rubell. The pair almost single-handedly thrust Murillo into the spotlight after spotting his work in 2012, visiting his studio, buying numerous paintings, and giving him studio space in their Miami home. Their commentary on the artist in a <i>New York</i> profile is alarmingly tone-deaf. “People are always trying to figure out what the power of the immigrant is…the power of the immigrant is that they always show up. You don’t always know if you can deliver, but you always show up. Oscar always shows up,” offers Mera Rubell. Elsewhere she compares his haircut to a “movie version of Basquiat’s” haircut, no doubt central to his initial appeal. The pair is certainly generous and hugely supportive of numerous young artists, but they are illustrative of the problems with contemporary patronage, and of why it is so difficult to encounter substantive explorations, or even incorporations, of race, gender, identity, and class in today’s fine art. I suspect a vast quantity of art that does this simply does not read to patrons like the Rubells. How could it?</span></p><p class="p1"><a href="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/the-nile.jpg"><img alt="the-nile" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1664" height="318" src="https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/the-nile.jpg?w=670&amp;h=318" width="670"/></a></p><p class="p1" style="text-align:center;"><em>Jean-Michel Basquiat, The Nile, 1983; acrylic and crayon on canvas, 172.5 x 358 cm; Collection Enrico Navarra.</em></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are so many extant questions I have about Murillo’s performance. Were his co-workers aware that he was the artist-in-residence? If not, were they primed not to expect the resident “artist” at Reynolds’s mansion (presuming there had been others) to have dark skin and speak Spanish? Which party guests, exactly, tried to dismiss his performance by invoking Paula Cooper as totemic of social activism in the art world? Where is the jumpsuit now, and might it be exhibited again? The white jumpsuit, blowing in the breeze, as it did at the party, would be a one-work exhibition stronger than the composite MOMA assemblage. What, exactly, is “atemporal” about living and art-making as a person of color, it would ask. Almost nothing. Staking a claim to non-historical existence is a privilege of the precious, white few.</span></p><p class="p1"><em>By Krithika Varagur, ’15</em></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/art/9768/where-life-meets-art-oscar-murillo-at-the-south-london-gallery.html"><span class="s2">¹ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/art/9768/where-life-meets-art-oscar-murillo-at-the-south-london-gallery.html</span></a> </span></p><p class="p1">² <span style="line-height:1.5;">René Ricard, “The Radiant Child,” </span><i style="line-height:1.5;">ArtForum</i><span style="line-height:1.5;">, December 1981.</span>  <a href="http://artforum.com/inprintarchive/id=35643" style="line-height:1.5;"><span class="s2">http://artforum.com/inprintarchive/id=35643</span></a></p><p class="p1">³ <a href="http://artforum.com/diary/id=48336" style="line-height:1.5;"><span class="s2">http://artforum.com/diary/id=48336</span></a></p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
