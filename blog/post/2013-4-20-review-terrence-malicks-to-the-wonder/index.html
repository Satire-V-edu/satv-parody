    <article>
        <p><p>Since the WWII film <i>The Thin Red Line</i> (1998), all of Terrence Malick’s movies have opened with voice-overs that play on some form of the mythic invocation. The war film and <i>The New World</i> (2005) begin with appeals to a higher power, the former interrogating the mysterious relationship between being and (human) nature. <i>The Tree of Life</i> (2011) begins, after a quotation from the Book of Job, with Jack addressing the family members he will remember and reconstitute throughout the rest of the movie. The first lines of <i>The New World</i> follow the exhortative model of the classical invocation most explicitly: “Come, Spirit,” Pocahontas says. “Help us sing the story of our land. You are our mother, we your field of corn. We rise from out of the soul of you.”</p><p>In each of these cases, the voice-over, though spoken by a character anchored in the present of the narrative proper, calls forth a power or presence from beyond the temporal or spatial bounds of the plot. Rather than affecting the substantive action of the story, they accompany its unfolding and overhang its representations. In other words, they act much in the way that a prophecy is structured: they project a mode of thinking into the future events of the film by taking recourse to a higher (divine) authority, but, through their infinite re-interpretability, they can also be applied to a variety of events in mutually conflicting ways. When Private Train asks, at the beginning of <i>The Thin Red Line</i>, “What’s this war in the heart of nature?” his words clearly perforate more than just his experience in Guadalcanal or the soldiers’ encounter with the South Pacific flora and fauna. What these opening lines have in common, then, is that they all open an arena of interpretation overseen by a higher presence that is marked by two things: its absence, and, via its absence, a latent promise of events to come that will complicate or elucidate the reasons for its initial invocation.</p><p><span id="more-900"></span></p><p>The first chapter of Malick’s newest film, <i>To the Wonder</i>, traces a fairly simple love story: Marina (Olga Kurylenko) is apparently an expatriate and struggling single mother in Paris, Neil (Ben Affleck) is apparently some sort of environmental rights worker from the United States, and, after they fall in love in France, she and her young daughter Tatiana return with him to Oklahoma (all of these details, though, even the characters’ names, are largely ambiguous, unstated or unexplored). The movie’s opening sequence both follows and breaks from the kind of invocatory beginning prevalent in Malick’s latest work. Marina speaks the opening lines over sequences of the couple, clearly romantically involved at this point, riding the TGV. Her voice-over comes from a point elsewhere than the moving train where the love story begins on screen, as she addresses Neil: “Newborn. I open my eyes. I melt. Into the eternal night. A spark. You got me out of the darkness. You gathered me up from earth. You’ve brought me back.” This opening invocation would appear to align with the beginning of <i>The Tree of Life</i>, in which Jack speaks,<i> “</i>Brother. Mother. It was they who led me to your door,” because Jack addresses another character who will appear in the film. But Jack appeals to his clouded memories of his deceased family members, not to loved ones we will observe him meeting as an adult, as Marina does. The connection between the biblical quotation and the opening line also summons a theological relationship and calls attention to actions still-to-come that will thicken this relationship with an interpretive grounding.</p><p class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 545px" rel="width: 545px"><a href="http://cinema-scope.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Tree-of-Life.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" class=" " height="273" src="http://cinema-scope.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Tree-of-Life.jpg" width="535"></a></p><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Still from</em> The Tree of Life,<em> </em><em>Terrence Malick, 2011. Image courtesy of cinema-scope.com</em><br></p><p>Marina’s higher power-to-come exists firmly in the narrative, and the impulse behind her opening words does not lend itself to interpretations that stray too far from the substance of her speech. In her rhetorical form, she is impetuous, eliding verbs and conjunctions and using nouns as clumsy emblems of her salvation. Malick represents Marina’s hysterical dependence in her first line, and the balance of power in the relationship fully reveals itself when, after Marina and her daughter find Oklahoma disillusioning, Neil refuses to marry her when her visa expires and she returns to Europe. After this point, Tatiana largely disappears: for some reason, she is put under the custody of her father and seems to fall out of touch with her mother. This mother-daughter relationship seemed to be the film’s most promising one, as Tatiana had a sense early on that Oklahoma was not the answer for her family (“Something’s missing,” she whispers to her mother), but, like many promising details, it dissipates in the transition into the film’s next chapter. Marina, though, largely ignores her daughter’s advice, holding out hope that Neil would finally decide to marry her and thereby allow her to stay in the US. After Marina returns to Europe, Neil kindles a relationship with Anna (Rachel McAdams), a rancher who lost her first child, and subsequently her marriage, sometime in the past.</p><p>Neil, in one enigmatic sequence of him pondering his relationships, spins a crystal ball on a window sill and watches it revolve. It traces two spheres – the revolutions of the ball itself as it spins on its axis, and the oval path it traces on the sill in its movement. For all its allegorical significance, it is an apt image for the way relationships work in <i>To the Wonder</i>, because, incredibly, Marina and Anna both spend large portions of their time with Neil by whirling in circles a few paces ahead of him. We are told Marina is a former ballet dancer, as if that explains anything. Clearly, though, it does not – Anna, the experienced rancher, is just as susceptible to these twirling swoons. After her first child died, she says, her father told her to “Read Romans. All things work together for good.” She dismissed the advice, but somehow her relationship with Neil seems to validate the Scripture, to retroactively beatify all else she had experienced before. Anna, too, could have spoken the film’s opening lines. Her expressions of helpless devotion to Neil’s moods and indecision express the same sentiment.  The possibility of Salvation, to be “brought back,” is clearly foregrounded in the film, especially by Marina’s opening lines. It is a heady theme that promises, from its early establishment, that the rest of the film will thicken the characters of two women pigeonholed into a kind of permanent manic-dependent state. But Anna, too, is rebuffed by Neil with little explanation (in fact, he hardly speaks at all in the entire film). The women whirl and entreat, plead and desire, chatter and scream. Malick does not make much space for them to do anything else.</p><p class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.trbimg.com/img-516f1b55/turbine/sc-mov-0416-to-the-wonder-20130418-001/600/600x400" target="_blank"><img alt="" height="400" src="http://www.trbimg.com/img-516f1b55/turbine/sc-mov-0416-to-the-wonder-20130418-001/600/600x400" width="600"></a></p><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Ben Affleck and Olga Kurylenko star in </em>To the Wonder<em>, Terrence Malick, 2013. Image courtesy of chicagotribune.com</em><br></p><p>Neil’s failing relationships are interspersed with scenes of Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), a Catholic priest, reciting sermons or walking through the poor neighborhoods and prisons of Oklahoma. He is clearly undergoing a religious crisis of theodicy, preaching to mostly empty pews about the necessity of loving God and making decisions in accordance with His will. He spends a great deal of his screen time peering into dilapidated houses but neglecting to knock on their doors, as if too ashamed or afraid to repeat these messages to the various disabled, poor and imprisoned figures who comprise, in montage, the problematic backdrop to the love story. One woman grabs his bible and tosses it into the grass, and, in the next sequence, he hides in his house as she calls for him to come to the door. The parallels between religious and spousal duty do not extend very far. Quintana and Neil are deeply unsettled by whom they serve and what values they prioritize, but the equation is troubling. Whether the ills of Oklahoma’s rural ghettos are meant to run alongside those of a luckless love, or the weak condolences of the Church are meant to be as pernicious as the indecisiveness of a man two women fall for, the representation of these links pit the beautiful cinematic representations of the romance against the darker images of the downtrodden. Malick’s cinematography, in other words, cannot help but push the images of societal rejects to the periphery of the romantic plot. These images’ relative narrowness – close shots of pained faces, lines of dingy homes, prisoners peering through bars – cannot accumulate enough energy to dislodge the romance, gorgeously filmed amidst the tides in Normandy, the streets of Paris, and the billowing fields of Oklahoma, from the film’s center.</p><p><i>To the Wonder</i> is marked by several stylistic moves Malick is famous for: the camera panning up to capture shafts of light broken by overhanging branches, the involuntary memory represented by jump cuts from a sense-perception to a remembered event (in <i>The Thin Red Line</i>, for example, Private Bell is transported back to sequences of moments with his wife when he feels the blades of grass rub against his body as he crawls toward an enemy bunker), and the edifice rendered uncanny for its isolation in a otherwise natural landscape. These series, like a reversal of the romantic fallacy that projects human emotions onto an a-human nature, soar above and leave behind the film’s sparse narrative and thematic content. The film’s aesthetic moments ultimately expose the weakness of their own foundation, like flying buttresses and leaping spires constructed on a corroded base. Malick’s movies so often achieve because they open, frequently at the outset, certain inquiries and problems that accompany the film’s subsequent images like preludes or overtures. In this sense, then, <i>To the Wonder</i> was doomed from its start.</p></p>
