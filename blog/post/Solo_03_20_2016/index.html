    <article>
        <p><p>For my upcoming show, I have created a piece just for you. It is intimate and personal. When you come to the wing of the museum where I have installed my work, you sheepishly pick up a program and hurry in. There is no one else here. They know this show is for you, and will be kind enough to leave you alone with it.<br></p><p><br></p>  <p>You pass into a great marble atrium. It is cool and grey and smells like wet rocks. Everyone you have ever known is facing you. They are not moving or even breathing, but they are looking at you. Your high school english teacher is looking at you kindly. Your sixth grade crush is looking at you kindly. The kid you babysat a couple times when you needed pocket money in college is looking at you kindly. </p><p><br></p>  <p>You duck behind a black curtain into a tiny dark room where a film plays. In the film, your first love is speaking, looking you right in the eye. "I am sorry," they are saying, "I am so sorry. I wish I could have been better. We were the real thing. I wish I would have been smarter and kinder and unafraid and had known how to better handle my feelings. You meant a lot to me." You put your hand to the wall, but there’s nothing to touch. You walk through the curtain on the other side of the room. Here is a glowing pink neon sign. The sign reads: "From now on everyone you love will love you precisely as much as you love them." The pink brightness reflects off the pool of water set in the floor, and you realize that it is not a pool but a canal. There is a very small canoe waiting for you. You climb in, and the water carries you through a tunnel where speakers project your parents’ voices; they are telling each other how proud of you they are.</p><p><br></p>  <p>The canal dries up and your canoe comes to a gravely halt. The tunnel is wide and dark. An engine roars to life – ahead is a city bus, sitting and waiting, presumably for you. You board, wondering how I convinced the museum to let me have a real live bus in a gallery space. "Welcome aboard," the driver says. You sit down. The other bus-goers, all of whom look vaguely familiar, smile warmly at you. They don't make small talk. They know you would rather sit in silence. But they are there if you would like to speak with them.  </p><p><br></p>  <p>The bus arrives in another large hall. “This is your stop,” an old woman in the seat across from you says gently. You pull the yellow cord and the bus stops, just for you. </p><p><br></p>  <p>The whole floor of the hall is covered with grass. Your childhood best friend is lying in the grass, watching clouds projected on the ceiling. At the end of the hall is a corridor. On the walls, the faces of your past lovers are projected. They are speaking amicably to one another. They are all agreeing that you have affected each and every one of them in some distinct but significant way. </p><p><br></p>  <p>At the end of the hall is a large wooden door. You open it. The room is several hundred feet tall, and in it stands the person you love most in the world. They are enormous, filling the entire room, and you stand only at the height of their pinky toe. A ladder hangs in the space between their feet and stretches indefinitely upwards. There is no door in the room, and so you start climbing. You climb, and you continue to climb, and you start to wonder about the museum’s safety regulations. They should at least have guards to call the paramedics if you should fall. There are no guards, and the ladder is rickety and unstable. You climb past their chest, and then their shoulder, their chin. The ladder trails in through their closed mouth, presumably hooked over a tooth. Their lips are latched together. You unhinge them, and the jaw snaps open. You climb into the cavern-sized mouth and crawl across their tongue, using molars as handholds. You slither backwards and your lover swallows, digesting you whole. You take a bath in stomach acid. The fizz rocks your nerves to sleep and you lie numb, rigid, and dreamless, drifting past the duodenum into the channels of the small intestine. You wash up in dripping pink tunnels, the kind that a truck-sized worm with a hundred-year lifespan might burrow in as his magnum opus. The walls are rough, damp, and fleshy, like the inside of a great lung. You round a corner and the tunnel stretches straight ahead. The vanishing point is a pinprick of light: an out? After an indeterminate amount of time it swells into not an exit but a television, flat-screen and twice your size. Your pupils are swollen from the dark, burning from the overdose of LEDs. Text scrolls across the screen. Exit through the large intestine, the screen says. Do not get absorbed by the epithelial cells of the small intestine. Do not become a nutrient. You walk past the television and into another, wider tunnel, which abruptly opens onto a sterile museum hallway. End of exhibit, a sign says. Ahead of you there is a gift shop.</p></p>
