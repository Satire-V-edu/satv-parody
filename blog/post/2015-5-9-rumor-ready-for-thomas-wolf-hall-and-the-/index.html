        <p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" frameborder="0" height="407" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5kT2lMkhldc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" type="text/html" width="670"></iframe></span></p><p>“Master Cromwell, your reputation is bad,” a red-bearded King Henry VIII tells the protagonist of PBS’s new Tudor-era series, <i>Wolf Hall. </i>Cromwell, sullen and overdressed in a sunlit hedge garden, lowers his chin, prompting the king’s bemusement.</p><p>“Your majesty can form your own opinion,” Cromwell replies. By the next episode, he’s been elected to the king’s privy counsel.<span id="more-1722"></span></p><p>The second episode of the series, based on Hilary Mantel’s best-selling novels, aired the night that another Hillary announced her bid for the 2016 presidential race. At the end of an extended montage-style video that nailed every demographic on its smiling, plucky middle-class head, Clinton gives the camera a grandmotherly smile.</p><p>“Everyday Americans need a champion. And I want to be that champion,” Clinton says. “So I’m hitting the road to earn your vote.”</p><p>Commentators have noted that the video signaled a marked departure from Clinton’s 2008 campaign—“I’m in to win it”—which spawned accusations of entitlement. This time around, Clinton will travel stoner-road-trip style from New York to Ohio; she’s already made news by stopping for Chipotle. “She’s trying to earn [voters’] support this time around,” a campaign advisor told <i>The New York Times.</i></p><p>In doing so, she might take a cue from Cromwell.</p><p>“Everyday Americans” (read: white, middle-class voters in swing states) are a little like 16th-century English monarchs: They like to form their own opinions. And Hilary Clinton is a little like Thomas Cromwell: She’ll make sure they form the right ones.</p><p>PBS’s <i>Wolf Hall, </i>lit almost entirely in candlelight, stands out from other Tudor-era adaptations in its remarkable subtlety. (HBO’s <i>The Tudors </i>surely featured no less than twelve ripped bodices, four botched beheadings, and at least one sensual fruit-eating scene per season). Thomas Cromwell, played with emotional depth and dynamic eyebrows by Mark Rylance, rarely speaks.</p><p>But he works hard, and he suffers. After his wife and daughters die of the sweating sickness, Cromwell shows up early to work. Bent over a pile of Cardinal Wolsey’s papers, his hands shake. “Um, when you were in France, my wife and daughters died,” he tells the cardinal, simply. As Dan Kois wrote in a smart piece for <i>Slate, </i>Cromwell “never takes work off.”</p><p>Cromwell comes from a low background, and everyone knows it. The camera often lingers on Cromwell as he enters a crowded room, eyes shifting between clusters of courtiers, like a new student looking for a spot in the cafeteria. When he joins Henry and a group of nobles at a shooting practice, one of them asks, “Who <i>are </i>you?” Cromwell ignores him, and shoots, nearly hitting the bull’s-eye. He tells the impressed king that he picked up the skill competing against the foresters and millers of his small town.</p><p>The nobles scoff, but Henry love the story. He asks Cromwell whether he might visit the town, someday, in disguise, for he so rarely sees that part of his realm (the 16th-century equivalent of a Midwestern swing state). On his third try, Cromwell hits his mark.</p><p>If Cromwell lived today, he would make an excellent candidate for the Democratic Party. Next to the shouting Henry (Ted Cruz?), he comes across as smart, humble, subdued.  He’s the ultimate underdog, and he knows it, and uses it. For, you see, the tricky thing about ambition, in both Renaissance and contemporary politics, is that you can’t let on that you have it. Whether you’re running for privy councilman or president, you must appear to work hard without really aiming for anything, sprinting on the treadmill while pretending not to know about the upcoming marathon.</p><p>When the cardinal’s corrupt, or Congress is deadlocked, it helps to be an underdog—a wry observer of the political scene, free (at least, in the imagination of the public or the king), from its sins.</p><p>Hillary Clinton, who has, after all, already <i>lived </i>in the White House, cannot be the underdog—but she can re-brand herself as one. Her campaign video shows her huddled over a table, Starbucks in hand. “I’m getting ready to run for something, too,” Clinton says in voiceover. “I’m getting ready to run for president.” Just another plucky everyday American, the announcement suggests.</p><p>The #ReadyforHillary campaign, brilliantly, does not only imply that Hillary worked her way to the top; it implies that <i>we </i>(us everyday Americans!) worked <i>for </i>her. If we thought that Hillary seemed entitled in 2008, now we feel entitled to have her. (<i>The Onion </i>satirized the slogan with the mock #IDeserveThis).</p><p>Coming from nothing, Cromwell had to overcome “Who <i>are </i>you?” With a last name that’s already followed the word “President,” Clinton has to overcome “You <i>again?”</i></p><p>Still, Cromwell and Clinton face similar tasks. Both must distance themselves from an incumbent of wavering popularity (Wolsey, Obama). Both must dismiss accusations of wrongdoing in a foreign land (Italy, Bengazi). Both must shun the curse of the “bad reputation.”</p><p>Both must work hard, without seeming obviously ambitious. Both must shape our opinions, subtly, from the shadows, while convincing us we’ve formed them ourselves.</p><p>As Cromwell kneels solemnly before the king, the scene cuts to a bawdy court play. Actors through a man, dressed as the fallen Cardinal Wolsey, into a painted devil’s mouth. Miles away, Wolsey, once the king’s most trusted advisor, dies alone.</p><p>Let it be a reminder of mercurial monarchs. Let it be a reminder of fickle, everyday, folks. Let it be a warning to Cromwell, and to Clinton.</p></p>
