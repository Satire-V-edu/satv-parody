    </a>
    
    <article>
        <p><p>I am now sixty-four years old and have been happily married for sixteen years—to a man. I have had a career as a successful corporate lawyer, working in New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Houston, and Beijing. </p><p>	I have, since my years at Harvard, never lived in the hot house that is Cambridge. So I have followed from afar the activities at Harvard.</p><p>	What I have always noted is that Harvard leads from behind. It is never the initiator of progress or justice. But when something becomes the vox populi, à la mode, or to use that horrid new abbreviation, “PC”, Harvard pursues it with a ruthlessness which only massive wealth can underwrite.</p><p>	Harvard rules by terror. That is amply demonstrated by William Wright’s book which only came out in 2005: Harvard’s Secret Court: The Savage 1920 Purge of Campus Homosexuals, which describes the surveillance and prosecution in in-house “trials” of gay students. These “trials” often led to suicides. Has Harvard ever apologized? To use a vulgar gay expression: “Get real, bitch!” Harvard does not apologize because Harvard never does anything wrong. To quote the song of the communist German Democratic Republic: “Die Partei hat immer Recht.” The Party is always right. Harvard bears more similarities in its attitudes and methods to communist regimes than to anything else I have encountered. It cowers its dissidents with very sophisticated and effective threats. It discerns its opponents’ soft spots and pierces them with stilettos. And Harvard does not cease until it has won—or until history has revealed Harvard’s position as wrong-headed and antediluvian. Then Harvard pretends it never took that position. Just a misunderstanding. Tell that to the suicides of the ’20’s.</p><p>	In the fall of 1972, my junior year, Dunster House did not have a room for me. The malevolent secretary at Dunster gave me a room with five strangers in which there was no bed for me. I had a friend in Kirkland House, whom I knew through my work at the Loeb Drama Center. He said he had assembled a group of gays in two suites of rooms at Kirkland and that they had an extra bed. I would be most welcome.</p><p>	Suddenly, for the first time at Harvard, I experienced happiness and hope. Dunster House and Kirkland House both consented to the move but I had to have it approved by some official in University Hall. I naively thought this was a formality, so one fall day I ascended the steps to that gray stone building and on the left saw the office of the person whose approval I needed. I entered smiling and saw a woman rather long in the tooth and with an unhappy, gnarled face. I was somewhat apprehensive but because I had been told this would be a “rubber stamp,” I was not terribly concerned. I explained to this woman that I wanted to change house and told her the circumstances. Dunster didn’t seem to have room for me, and a collection of my closest friends were living together in Kirkland and had invited me to join them. There was room for me at Kirkland, and both Dunster and Kirkland had consented.</p><p>	The ancient crone’s face became twisted with scarcely suppressed rage. Barely in control of herself, she asked sharply: “Who has asked you to join them?” I told her the names, which she carefully wrote down—from time to time asking the correct spelling. (Obviously the techniques learned in the trials of the 1920’s had been passed down. An unholy apostolic succession.) Then she blurted out: “We know what you people are trying to do and we will not allow it.”</p><p>	I tried to explain that no one had objected to it and that it made sense given the limited boarding space at that time. She responded: “That is all irrelevant. We know what you people are trying to create and I will not allow it. Please leave my office at once.” Obviously I complied.</p><p>	I was in utter shock. I felt the deepest humiliation I have ever felt. I told my friend in Kirkland and he was also shocked, indeed speechless. I decided to move off-campus and I did. Of course I had to pay the $500 per semester off-campus penalty fee and I did, every semester. By being off-campus I was automatically allocated to Dudley House, which was not a bad thing. Being responsible for so many graduate students, Dudley had a level of sophistication far greater than that of the other Houses. They helped me in numerous ways. Obviously, not on gay issues. The latter seldom come up in a “House” without bedrooms.</p><p>	I had entered Harvard as a freshman in 1970. I had a Southern accent and people, very politely, thought I was stupid. I was not. I gained all A’s my first semester, my first year and for my entire time at Harvard. I was one of the junior twelve in Phi Beta Kappa. My thesis won the Bowdoin Prize. I am no dummy.</p><p>I would have had a summa but for the personal animosity and unfairness of Brooke Hopkins, that ersatz aristocrat then in the English department. He had given me a cum on my thesis; the other grader, a graduate student (and they usually are harsher), gave me a summa. Right before my oral exam, the winners of the Bowdoin Prize were announced. Harvard does not tell anyone this but in the humanities, the oral is the only thing that matters. I walked into an ambush. My examiners were my great friend and the great scholar Professor Herschel Baker and Brooke Hopkins. The latter was of course miffed because the Bowdon Prize exposed him as being horribly wrong about my thesis. I ended up with a magna. That is Harvard. When Harvard acts fairly, it is by pure chance, and Harvard treated me very unfairly. I will always wonder whether the fact that my thesis comparing the literary styles and methods of Byron and Petronius and touching on some gay themes influenced Hopkins. </p><p>With the support of Dudley House and Professor Walter Jackson Bate, I was awarded a Marshall Scholarship and graduated with high honors at Oxford in Literae Humaniores (the hardest course at Oxford: in a two-week period one must complete twenty exams on Latin and Greek literature, philosophy, logic and history). </p><p>	Despite its pretensions to being a liberal institution, Harvard never was and still is not. It is quite simply a massive money-gathering machine. It pursues irrelevant chimeras, such as the admission of women to the truly irrelevant Final Clubs, purely as a diversion, and as a camouflage for its intention to wipe out the Final Clubs and buy their land—essential to Harvard’s reckless expansion. Harvard has never and will never do anything bold for human rights—it will not displease its generous donors, most of whom give to ensure that their little darlings gain admission. What Harvard does in the name of equality or human rights, is diversionary. It fills space in the Crimson and occupies reporters.</p><p>In the early 1970’s homosexuality was not “in” and tolerance not “PC.” Those of us who were gay knew Harvard would never be a support and would almost certainly be our persecutor. Hence we moved furtively and hid our nature—even from very close friends. My sophomore roommate in Dunster was gay but I only learned it at a Harvard reunion in the 1990’s. Each of us had constructed elaborate ruses and excuses for our nighttime absences—completely unaware we were each playing the same game.</p><p>I remember attending the first Harvard gay student group meeting in Claverly in 1970 or 1971, where we all came in the greatest secrecy. (The Crimson had very bravely put in a little announcement beforehand. I still have it.) This was the dreariest assemblage I have ever attended. It was a very small group, and all were in terror. Bizarrely we spoke in whispers. Anyone who has been in Claverly knows what a massive pile that building is and how thick the walls are. The meeting was a fiasco. Almost entirely political talk; no plans whatsoever to organize gatherings where Harvard gays could meet and socialize. When I suggested that, the group looked at me as if I were a unicorn. We left either alone or in groups of two, to avoid attracting any attention. We knew we could have adverse consequences, possibly even expulsion, if exposed.</p><p>As a consequence of this horrid environment of fear and danger, one saw some of the brightest minds in America meeting for sex in the men’s rooms of Lamont Library. I have no doubt that men who are now Nobel laureates had furtive sex in those filthy stalls.</p><p>The gay scene in Boston was hardly accessible to Harvard students. There was Sporters, a bar on Beacon Hill, that stayed open far past the hour the subway closed, and in those days gays tended to choose a partner (we called them “tricks”) just before a bar closed. There was also the Other Side, which many of us reached somehow and then somehow returned to Harvard—walking over rail yards and vacant streets. Once I met someone at the Other Side and he inflicted on my neck numerous hickeys. I took from him a scarf and wore it during my classes on that dreadful day, when I was terrified my tendencies would be revealed. In those times we lived in such fear and panic, I did not see the obvious: a woman could also have been the source of the marks. </p><p>	The students were outwardly almost to a man very homophobic—or scared—and the “gay thing” was never mentioned except in mockery and derision. The reason is not hard to find. Everyone at Harvard had been top of his class and was programmed for success. The family pressure must have been horrendous. Homosexuality was inconsistent with success at that time. Thus everyone tried to prove he was an avid heterosexual and what better way than to denigrate gays?</p><p>	I remember several particularly humiliating experiences at the hand of fellow students, and one student and one incident in particular. One night my friend in Kirkland, Steve Lonsdale (a beautiful human being but sadly now dead) and his roommate who was a very talented artist, had a party in their rooms in Kirkland House. A jock I vaguely knew in Kirkland House (now it appears he is a highly respected physician), and his jock friends pulled the fire alarm lever. We all came down – the artist in a black silk brocade dressing gown—and they stood in the quad pointing and laughing at us. To any observer we were clearly a bunch of homosexuals having a clandestine party. Sometime later I saw that an exercise class was being offered at the Harvard gym. This malevolent jock turned out to be the instructor and made fun of me in front of the class. I never returned to the class and I have never forgiven this humiliation. </p><p>Curiously enough, though few clubbies were gay, one very seldom heard anti-gay remarks in the Final Clubs. I remember only one such remark—from a rather dim clubbie who had just forgotten to go to a final exam. (He was twice a sophomore.) But I heard a continuous stream of anti-gay bile in the dining halls of the Houses, particularly Dunster and Lowell. </p><p>Harvard was the most poisonous environment in which I have ever lived. I had been at prep school, and the Episcopal priest was later found to have molested numerous male students in my time at the school (not me). This only came out in the last twenty years and soon after these facts were exposed to the world the man died. But there was no persecution of gays at my prep school. The administration of St. Stephen’s Episcopal School in Austin would not have stood for it and certainly would not have organized or participated in it. Dr. Becker, the headmaster, was a very moral and tolerant man. He admitted African Americans when most Texans abhorred that. Dr. Becker was a leader in tolerance and fundamental justice for all human beings. Harvard has always been a very distant follower. There was no gay persecution and Dr. Becker would have personally dismissed any faculty member who attempted it. Texas is not the backwater Yankees think we are. Unlike Harvard, St. Stephen’s was not born in sin. See page 71 of Mr. Wright’s book: William Bradford “presided over the execution of a teenager” for the “crime” of buggery (what a quaint term as the main character in “The Boys in the Band” put it.).</p><p>My life at the very tolerant St. Stephen’s explains my utter shock during my first weeks at Harvard. I quickly perceived that this was not St. Stephen’s; this was a dangerous place, and in this environment of fear, I redoubled my academic efforts and won A’s in the hardest courses—mostly graduate courses in the humanities as well as organic and physical chemistry courses. I spent days in the labs—more than anyone else. I recently found the postcard from the chemistry professor giving me my grades: Lab: 100+, course A+. Perhaps unknowingly he violated Harvard’s protocols. There is no A+ at Harvard. But this is a strong indication of how I submerged myself.</p><p>Faulkner was at fault. In The Sound and the Fury, he elevated Harvard, for Southerners, to a status it does not deserve and never has. They sold Benjy’s field so Quentin could go to Harvard. I firmly believe I did not receive at Harvard the education I deserved – and for which which my father worked hard to pay for. Recently I have looked online at the chemistry curriculum at MIT, which had also accepted me. It is awesome. Logically structured and not haphazard like so much at Harvard. Harvard is at times all tissue paper and paper mache. A Potemkin village. There is no wizard. Too much teaching was done by graduate students. There were a few—a very few—great professors (Bate, Baker, Clausen, etc. in the humanities; Watson, Ball and von Eggers Döring in science are just a few examples), but the average level did not impress me. (I think MIT was so occupied with their academics and research, they gave no though to whether a person was gay. I may be wrong. But the MIT of today is clearly not Nirvana—their behavior in the case of Aaron Swartz is reprehensible.) </p><p>	It is hard for people today to understand that in the 1970’s there was no support system at Harvard for gays. There was no place to run. The Advocate, the Signet Society and the Loeb Drama Center were unique in their toleration. They provided safe havens where no questions were asked and where an anti-gay statement or joke would have been as out of order and condemned as much as a statement of anti-semitism. From my only visit to the Lampoon (as an applicant), I quickly saw this was a different environment. More like the Houses. I may have been wrong about them, but I withdrew my application that very night. What will surprise most readers most is that the Final Clubs, with one notable exception (not the Porcellian, but the Club that from time to time flew the Nazi flag before its house), were almost all tolerant—but again in a very quiet way. But other than The Advocate, the Signet Society, the Loeb Drama Center, and to some extent the Clubs, there were no other havens. Once can say with truth, the more influence Harvard had over a place or group, the less tolerant it was likely to be. But this was Harvard, and Harvard hated homosexuality. Harvard’s influence on groups and daily life cannot be overemphasized. Harvard set the tenor, and in fear almost every undergraduate complied with, and even participated in, the intolerance.</p><p>	When I say haven, I mean neutrality and the absence of anti-gay slurs. I never witnessed any flirting (except at the Loeb) or sexual advances (again, except at the Loeb).</p><p>An incident that will show my naivite occurred in my first year. I was desperately searching for a haven and a way to meet like-minded friends. There was an ad in the Crimson asking for volunteers to work on Leonard Lehrman’s production of Bertold Brecht’s The Days of the Commune. This play dealt with the communist commune that arose in Paris in 1871 after France’s defeat by Germany. It was a short-lived event but was of historical importance as the first Marxist state. It is a long and lugubrious play. I applied and was accepted and worked closely with Leonard in translating the work and in coordinating the cast. I think we had 60 cast members. Leonard was a very talented musician—and already then recognized as such—and I felt honored to be allowed to work with him. One night (it happened to be my birthday) as we were working on the text, Leonard said, “I’ve heard you are homosexual.” I turned white as a sheet and vigorously denied it. Only later did I learn that homosexuality is inconsistent with Marxist theory. I finished the play but had nothing more to do with this group.</p><p>	I graduated in the spring of 1974 with more honors and prizes and citations than possibly any other student. I did not attend graduation, and I learned it created an embarrassment to Dudley House (which I regret) and the College (which I most certainly do not regret) when my name would be called and no one appeared. My friend Peter Gomes had invited me to his very exclusive graduation party. When I was a no-show, he never spoke to me again. I was very close to Peter. We drove together to Plymouth to visit his lovely, genteel mother. But even Peter lived in morbid fear.</p><p>I left Harvard the day after my last exam. I flew back to Austin, to the joys of the local bar scene and of Hippy Hollow on Lake Travis, where the gays would lie nude on the limestone boulders and swim in the crystal clear water. I felt like I had been released from a dark hell into the bright sunshine of life.</p><p>A few weeks later I received my Harvard diploma in the mail and immediately threw it in the trash.</p><p><br></p><p>POSTSCRIPT: </p><p>Only later did I learn how hard my father, also a lawyer, had worked to put me through Harvard. Harvard had infected me with an arrogance that caused me to ignore the cost. I had no scholarship. I paid full fare.</p><p>So this piece is dedicated to my father, Jack Dixon Welch II, a man who made massive sacrifices for me which I did not acknowledge at the time and who never tolerated intolerance in any form. </p></p>
