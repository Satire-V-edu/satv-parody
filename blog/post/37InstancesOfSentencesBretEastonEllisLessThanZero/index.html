    <h1 class="article-title">37 Instances Of Sentences In Which Character(s) Are Introduced Into A Scene Along With A Description Of Their Outfit(s) In Bret Eason Ellis’ Less Than Zero</h1>
    
    <a href="../../contributor/105.html" class="no-decoration">

    <article>
        <p><p>Bret Easton Ellis’ characters are
sexy, but they also wear cool stuff. Here are 37 (perhaps every; it’s a non-exhaustive study) instances of sentences in which character(s) are
introduced into a scene along with a description of their outfit(s) in his debut
novel, <i>Less Than Zero</i>. This is like
one of those great street style articles on <i>Refinery29</i>
that can yield 40 unique page lands in the course of one article with word
count ~ 500. Or an exposé of the
stupidity of some sort of sartorial physiognomy. Nevertheless, feast your eyes
on some sweet word threads. Emphasis on any mention of rock-T’s. They’re hot
again.</p><p><br></p><p>[Page citations from “First Vintage Contemporaries Edition," June 1998]<br></p><p><br></p><ol><li>Not the stain on the arm of the wrinkled, damp shirt I wear, a shirt which had looked fresh and clean this morning. Not the tear on the neck of my gray argyle vest, which seems vaguely more eastern than before, especially next to Blair’s clean tight jeans and her pale-blue T-shirt. P. 9</li><li>I bring Daniel to Blair’s party that night and Daniel is wearing sunglasses and a black wool jacket and black jeans. P. 12</li><li>She’s wearing a black leather jacket and matching pants and no shoes and she hugs me and then looks at Daniel. P. 12-13</li><li>I spot Daniel, who’s talking to this pretty tan girl who’s wearing a Heaven cut-off T-shirt and a black-and-white miniskirt and I whisper to him that we’re leaving and he gives me this look and says, “Don’t give me any shit.” P. 21-22</li><li>Kim is wearing pink sunglasses and she also lights one and then Alana asks for one. P. 27</li><li>There’s also this old guy with longish gray hair and a Giorgio Armani sweater and moccasins on who wanders past Alana and me and he begins to talk to Rip. P. 34</li><li>“The girl I came with just left with that Japanese guy in the English Beat T-shirt and tight white pants.” P. 36</li><li>This kid has really short, spiked blond hair and a Fear T-shirt on and a black leather bracelet strapped to one of his wrists. P. 50</li><li>I drive to her house in Beverly Hills and she’s wearing a pink hat and a blue miniskirt and yellow gloves and sunglasses and she tells me that at Fred Segal today someone told her that she should be in a band. P. 54</li><li>I hardly know anyone at the party and I finally find Daniel sitting, drunk and alone, by the pool, wearing black jeans and a white Specials T-shirt and sunglasses. P. 54</li><li>Jared walks in, not with Blair’s father, but with a famous model who doesn’t take off her fur coat and Jared doesn’t take off his dark glasses. P. 66</li><li>Kim finally does, wearing tight faded jeans, high black leather boots, white T-shirt, smoking a joint. P. 79</li><li>Julian’s not at the house on King’s Road either, but some guy with braces and short platinum blond hair and a bathing suit on lifting weights is in the backyard. P. 90</li><li>Lene is too tan and only wearing faded jeans and this totally revealing Hard Rock Café T-shirt and she’s with this really young blond boy who’s also too tan and he’s wearing sunglasses and shorts and Lene shouts, “ Oh my God. Blair. Kimmy.” P.98</li><li>The fat girl has a lot of makeup on and she’s sipping a Tab with a straw and wearing purple Calvin Klein jeans and matching cowboy boots. P. 108</li><li>Atiff, who I haven’t seen since graduation, is sitting on the couch wearing Gucci loafers and an expensive Italian suit. P. 110</li><li>My psychiatrist’s wearing red V-neck sweater with nothing on underneath and a pair of cut-off jeans. P. 122</li><li>He’s very tan and has the beginnings of a blond beard and wears glasses and ripped Tretorn tennis shoes and he keeps talking about the “aesthetic indifference” in American movies. P. 130</li><li>Jared and Blair’s father and the director of <i>Star Raiders</i> and the costume designer walk in and sit down and the talk soon turns to the Australian actor and Blair’s father asks the director, who’s wearing a Polo sweatsuit and dark glasses, why the actor is in town. P. 130</li><li>Rip and I drive there one night because Du-pair’s is crowded with teenage boys coming from toga parties and old waitresses wearing therapeutic shoes and lilacs pinned to their uniforms who keep telling people to be quiet. P. 136</li><li>David’s wearing sunglasses and a Fear T-shirt and tells me that he saw me at Kim’s New Year’s Eve party. P. 136</li><li>The man who’s talking has gray hair, pink-tinted sunglasses and very wide lapels on his jacket and he’s holding a microphone. P. 140</li><li>The maid answers the door and leads me out to the backyard, where Daniel’s mother, who I met at Parents Day at Camden in New Hampshire, is playing tennis in her bikini, her body greased with tanning oil. P. 146</li><li>Dimitri’s wearing black Speedos and a sombrero and is holding an electric guitar, trying to play “L.A. Woman,” but he can’t play the guitar too well because his hand was recently rebandaged after he sliced it open at the New Garage and everytime [sic] his hand comes down on the guitar, his face flinches. P. 147</li><li>He came with Wilson, another of my grandfather’s aides, and he was wearing a red baseball cap, and he carried around clippings of how the weather in Nevada had been for the past tow months. P. 155</li><li>He was dressed in the same jacket and the same string tie, and Wilson was wearing the same red baseball cap. P. 162</li><li>The boy who’s only wearing gray shorts, and who I recognize as the boy who was leaving Rip’s apartment the day Rip was supposed to meet me at Café Casino, and he stares at us malevolently as we walk in. P. 167</li><li>The door’s opened by a man, forty, forty-five, wearing slacks and shirt and a tie, who asks, “Yes… what may I do for you?” P. 173</li><li>Rip’s wearing black 501’s and a white X T-shirt and Spin’s wearing a T-shirt that reads: “Gumby. Pokey. The Blockheads” and black 501’s also. P. 184</li><li>A dark boy with a thin mustache and an “Under the Big Black Sun” T-shirt bumps into me and Rip grabs his shoulders and pushes him back into the dancing crowd and shouts “Fuckin’ Spic!” P. 185</li><li>Rip and I were driving on Mulholland one day before I left and Rip was chewing on a plastic eyeball and wearing a Billy Idol T-shirt and kept flashing the eyeball between his lips. P. 194</li><li>They haven’t gone to school today and they’re wearing shorts and T-shirts and sunglasses and I’m wearing an old Polo bathing suit and a T-shirt. P. 196-197</li><li>He’s wearing sandals and a Hard Rock Café T-shirt and he glances at me once then looks down then looks back up. P. 197</li><li>They’re still wearing their bikinis and sunglasses and they lie beneath the darkening sky and play a game in which they pretend to be dead. P. 198</li><li>I was wearing jeans and a T-shirt and an old baggy argyle sweater and tennis shoes with no socks and my hair was unbrushed and I was smoking a cigarette. P 200</li><li>There was a young surfer in the booth next to min in OP shorts and a yellow T-shirt with “MAUI” etched across it and I was pretty sure that he was waiting for the bus. P. 200</li><li>A car pulled up with a license plate that read “GABSTOY” and a girl with a black Joan Jett haircut, probably Gabs, and her boyfriends, who was wearing a black Clash T-shirt, got our of the car, motor still running, and I could hear the strains of an old Squeeze song. P. 200</li></ol></p>
