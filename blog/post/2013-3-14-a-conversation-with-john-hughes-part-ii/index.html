Now, this is a large and existentially fraught question—especially if we accept the premise of </i>Someone Else<i>—but let’s give it a crack: How and why do you see yourself in the work of some and not others?</i></p><p>John Hughes: It’s such a difficult question to answer, I think, because it’s really about what gets under your skin, isn’t it? What irritates you, what stimulates you—what gets in under there begins to take its own life within you. And it’s something I was thinking about a lot when I was writing that book <i>Someone Else</i>, and I just couldn’t get to the bottom of it, thinking: what is it about Kafka, or what is it about Chekhov, or what is it about Borges, or what is about Dostoevsky? Certainly for the Russian writers I might say it’s something to do with the romance I have as a result of my family background, but even there, there are a lot of Russian writers, you know, so why some rather than others?</p><p><span id="more-792"></span></p><p>And I really don’t know, I mean, do <i>you</i> have a sense of why it is that you like some writers rather than others? For instance, with Wallace Stevens, I loved him as an undergraduate and wrote my undergraduate honors thesis on Stevens, and I think Stevens appealed to something very cerebral in me at that time—I think at that time I had a sense of myself as hopefully being someone who could write poetry in the way that Stevens wrote poetry, in the grandiose ways that young people can think about those things, because I loved Stevens’s verse and I loved his critical writings as well. I kind of fell in love with him, I think, and that’s strange because when you look at Stevens the man, he didn’t seem like a terribly interesting man outside the writing, but I think there’s something quite nice about that too, whereas if you look at Dostoevsky, the life is as rich and fascinating and bizarre as anything that’s there in the fiction. And so Stevens really appealed to me at a particular point in my life, but I find now it’s not that I don’t like Stevens as a poet, I just don’t feel the same things about him any more as I did at that time. Maybe that’s because I spent so much time writing about him that it just went a little bit stale. I did my PhD on Coleridge and I find Coleridge a little bit difficult to enjoy, now, so in a sense doing long critical study on a writer can be a kiss of death, unfortunately, though that doesn’t always happen.</p><p>At this sort of distance, now, I can see why Stevens appealed to me at that time, with his connection to Romanticism and some of the Romantic aesthetic ideas, and all of that interested me very much in an intellectual way. I think now my interests are somewhat different from that, so he doesn’t speak to me with the same force—doesn’t get under my skin in the same way he probably did thirty or so years ago—and maybe with an equivalent time period, I might be able to answer your question, but that’ll probably be a bit late for this interview, so it’s very difficult to say exactly why.</p><p>AJBW:<i> Have you always known you wanted a life in literature? Were there any major setbacks to that pursuit? I read a great story about your search for a “life in letters ” … </i></p><p>JJH: Well, what happened was when I was doing my PhD at Cambridge, not long after the beginning I became less and less interested in the scholarly work and more and more interested in writing creatively. So I spent more and more time working on things that weren’t directly related to my thesis—which is problematic when you’re supposed to be producing a PhD: it wasn’t neglected entirely but it was becoming more and more sidelined. My supervisor was very very keen on me staying on in Cambridge, so there was all this talk about finishing the PhD and then I would apply for fellowships so I could continue my time there.</p><p>What she said to me was that if all else failed, she knew some people in the postal service there, so I could always get a job as a postman in Cambridge. And so I thought it was a wonderful irony, there, that I would still be able to achieve a “life in letters” without getting a PhD.</p><p>AJBW:<i> We’ve already talked about the relationship between your reading and your writing, and a bit about the freedom you get from responding with irreverence to tradition—but let’s talk specifically about the English language and your growing up in Australia with a strong interest in Europe. What was the process like of rediscovering your roots, linguistically? Did you read these figures only in translation? I think of the quote in the preface to </i>Someone Else<i>, when the young man obsessed with Celan corners Max Brod in a Coogee Beach café: “It’s not just that I feel a stranger in my own language,” he laments. “I’m not even at home in my imagination.” What role does language play in your own imagination, especially as concerns your interest in exile and tradition?</i></p><p>JJH: I’ll approach this in a chronological, biographical way to build a response. My grandfather chose to come to Australia when he was in a displaced persons camp in Bagnoli, just outside of Naples, in 1949. He chose Australia because it was just about as far from Europe on the map as you could see: the choice was really one of “I want to get away from this mad hellhouse and I never want to come back.” And the second thing was that it was an island, so there wasn’t a sense of having these powerful voracious neighbors there.</p><p>So when he came out here, I think he had a very, very strong sense of a Year Zero when he arrived. He wanted his children to forget about Ukraine and his background altogether, to be cleansed of all this past and all this memory, and to begin as if they had been born here and grown up in this place. He forbade the language being spoken: English was the only language allowed. That was always going to be an impossibility, because the children had already had too much of Ukrainian Russian so that English would always be a second language for them, and it was always going to be a more difficult language for them to think in and speak in. So when I was growing up, when my grandfather wasn’t around, my mother and grandmother used to speak Ukrainian Russian all the time—it was never translated for me, but it was a language that I heard all the time, and when I was very young it was the only language I heard for a large part of the day, until my grandfather came home and everybody had to switch into English.</p><p>And so I grew up with one language in my head that was really just like music, because it had no semantic meaning for me—although it’s probably unfair to say it had <i>no</i> semantic meaning, because I think I gradually came to understand the meanings of many words, so I’ve found when I’ve visited over there that I can actually understand a reasonable amount, certainly more than I would have thought I’d be able to. These words stuck, or this language stuck, but it stuck as a kind of music, so I’ve grown up with the language I communicate in, which has meaning for me and in which I think, but then this other language which is like a stream that runs beneath it, which is like a kind of dark, musical language—a language almost without meaning, or a language which means like music, so it speaks to me directly, emotionally, viscerally, all these sorts of things.</p><p>I think that’s one of the reasons why, in just about everything I write, language seems to be a subject—whether or not it’s an explicit one, as it is say for instance in <i>The Remnants</i>, where translation is a key component, and where in fact the novel is set up on the premise that it’s translated from the Russian—but I’ve never really thought about this too deeply, because I’m worried that if I do I might kill the goose that lays the golden egg, in a way, I might remove whatever tension, whatever irritations are that that stimulate my imagination. In one way, I think, what I’ve really been trying to do is to make the semantic language more closely approximate to the musical language, or I suppose what I’m concerned about is the music of language, even though language is what we use to communicate. There’s something I always love that Robert Frost once wrote: he wrote about “the sound of sense,” and I think for me if something doesn’t sound right, then it’s not working.</p><p>So there’s that, and the other thing I’ve become more aware over time is that language knows much more than we do. In a sense, we’re spoken by language as much as we actually use the language, and by starting to listen to the musical qualities of language—this is something that poets get by forcing themselves into pre-existing structures like rhythms, rhyme schemes, <i>et cetera</i>: being forced to have second thoughts—you can begin to discover things that you didn’t know you knew. You learn things through the process of writing itself, and that’s really one of the key things for me, that when I sit down to write it’s hopefully to write things that I didn’t know I knew.</p><p>I think one of the real impetuses that is this dark language which is there that I don’t know, and I suppose that’s because in a way it probably takes me back to that experience of being there with my mother and grandmother, it takes me back to the origins of language itself—or certainly the origins of my language and language learning. I remember being at Cambridge in the middle ’80s, and Germaine Greer was giving a lecture, and she said that she never read things in translation. She’s never read any Thomas Mann, for instance, because she refuses to read a book in translated. And I thought, OK, maybe there’s some nobility in that desire. But I find myself thinking almost the exact opposite of that. I think that when I read in translation I’m getting two books for the price of one, that what I’m getting is what the original language has done inside of someone else, and in that process of translating one language into another, you’re actually opening new possibilities for doing things in the host language, so it’s always been for me one way of enriching the host language in this process.</p><p>So even though I might be able to understand a little bit of German, a little bit of French, a little bit of Italian, I certainly don’t know nearly enough to appreciate the value of translations—but it doesn’t really bother me because I’m not judging the quality of the translation itself, it’s more just about what it actually does in English. Maybe it’s  another sacrilege to think like this, but it’s never really been something that’s bothered me at all. In fact, it’s been something that I really enjoy. I enjoy the fact that the original text remains largely inaccessible to me in terms of its semantics again, but at the same time it still has a kind of music for me, but because it’s a language that doesn’t mean, and I find that a really exciting experience rather than one that causes anxiety for me.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
