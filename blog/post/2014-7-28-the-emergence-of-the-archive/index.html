Previously relegated to the dark, climate-controlled labyrinths below universities, federal buildings and private collections, the archive has emerged into daylight. The repositories of the everyday now interact directly with the everyday, to unusual effect.<span id="more-1443"></span></p><p>In the <em>New York Times</em>, Nick Bilton describes the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/fashion/on-social-media-memories-linger-after-a-breakup.html?_r=0">difficulty of erasing memories</a> that have been documented on social media. “Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other sites are happy to lure you to post every intricate moment of your relationships online. Yet when things go wrong, these social tombs do nothing to help people easily delete those memories.” In <em>The Atlantic</em> Julie Buntin shares her <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/shes-still-dying-on-facebook/373904/">obsession with her deceased friend Lea’s Facebook profile</a>. Her painful account charts the decline of Lea’s emotional and physical health through the statuses and pictures she posted online. And in the <em>New Yorker</em>, Adam Gopnik has <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/07/stones-and-bones">criticized the 9/11 Memorial Museum</a> as a space “luridly profuse in its documentary imagery….”</p><p>Each of these pieces registers the influence of digital records on the increasingly unsettling relationship between us, our memories, and the dead. In a world that saves our photos, thoughts, and communications automatically, the things we leave behind have an ever greater tendency to rub up against us. It has become increasingly difficult to bury the past, which frustratingly, eerily, keeps getting folded over the present like pizza dough.</p><p>We love and value the archive. It allows us to piece together and interpret fragments of the past, and recast them as keys to the future. The archive is systematic: it shows us that reality is organized, and that we can make sense of life (at least, in retrospect). We fetishize the archive. When stepping into a frigid room, full of boxes that haven’t been touched by human hands in decades, we feel powerful: we have a secret, a life that will now open up to us as vividly as the yellowed letters and photographs allow. The archive holds an important position in our cultural imagination. For those of us who have never personally sifted through John Keats’s love letters, we experience the soothing and tantalizing nature of the archive through books, movies, and museums.</p><p>But it is the imagined distance of the archive that makes these sensations possible in the first place. The archive has to be far away. We imagine it underground, impeccably clean, and perfectly ordered in long corridors of metal filing cabinets. Too much contact with an archive can feel strange. To be alive among so much dead matter can be uncanny. In <em>Cronos</em>, Guillermo del Toro’s (emphatically unsexy) vampire film, the ailing villain Dieter de la Guardia possesses the archive of an alchemist who, centuries ago, attained eternal life. The creepiest scenes in the film take place in Dieter’s archive-cum-bedroom: an austere and sterile storehouse for dead secrets and the man’s grotesque, cadaverous form. Meanwhile, the protagonist, who has accidentally injected himself with the elixir of life, becomes a bloodthirsty vampire who, though appearing younger and stronger, also shows signs of decomposition. His skin burns in sunlight, and peels off like leaves of yellowed paper. Underneath, his new hide is the color of alabaster. As an undead, he is not ended — and yet, he must sleep in a chest in the attic like a forgotten thing.</p><p>Today, the archive is uncomfortably close. In a hyperbolic flourish, I would like to claim that many of us, documentarians and curators of our own lives, have reached the status of the undead. Like zombies, we pop up in each other’s news feeds and Instagrams. Bilton notes in his article that when he does a Google Image search of ”Nick Bilton,” his ex-wife, by some magical algorithm, pops up. He worries about what relatives and future girlfriends will see when they look at his profile, and laments that Facebook makes it frustratingly hard to get rid of unwanted memories: hundreds of photos and messages must be deleted one at a time. In her article, Buntin writes that since Lea’s biological death, “she’s died again and again…. Facebook has made her death a sort of high-concept horror movie. How many more times will I grieve her? How many more details from my past, from Lea’s past, are buried online, waiting for me to uncover them?” Buntin goes on to describe Lea’s wall, which has turned into a virtual memorial. There is something uncanny about the similarities between communicating to and remembering a friend on Facebook. Social media enacts a leveling process between the living and the dead.</p><p>We face these issues on a grander scale as well. Gopnik observes in “Stones and Bones” that memorial museums exist for the purpose of discovery, preservation, and learning. Holocaust museums, for instance, make public memories that have been rescued from obscurity. In so doing, they “memorialize the dead without becoming macabre.” “What happened on 9/11,” he continues, “by contrast, was a crime deliberately committed in open air as a nightmarish publicity stunt, one already as well documented as any incident in history. We can’t relearn it; we can only relive it.” There is nothing to uncover or piece together. The trauma of the event simply repeats itself: photographs, phone calls, pieces of twisted metal.</p><p>The emergence of the archive isn’t necessarily a bad thing—my allusions to the undead are meant to amuse as much as alarm—but this phenomenon is one we must address. We now live in what Foucault described as “the epoch of juxtaposition, the epoch of the near and far, of the side-by-side, of the dispersed.” We no longer live in the world as beings following trajectories; rather, we live in an ever-blossoming network in which the people and places we engage with constantly overlap. Now that overlapping temporalities and modes of being have emerged, we must come up with new ways to cope, to bury, because the way we humanize the dead speaks volumes about the way we live in the world.</p><div class="wpa wpmrec">
