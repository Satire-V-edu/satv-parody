        <p><p style="color:#666666;"><a href="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/4.jpg"><img alt="4" class="aligncenter wp-image-1388" height="332" src="http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/4.jpg?w=332&amp;h=332" width="332"/></a></p><p style="color:#666666;"><em style="font-weight:inherit;">On April 27th, we brought you the first installment of Heroines, a conversation between Indiana Seresin ’15  and Liza Batkin ’15. Below, you’ll find the second installment. If you’re interested, here’s Indiana’s piece<em style="font-weight:inherit;"> in the TRIAL issue, <a href="http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/against-new-feminism" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#001919;">“Against New Feminism</a></em><a href="http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/against-new-feminism" style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#001919;">.”</a> </em></p><p style="color:#666666;"><span id="more-1415"></span></p><p><strong>Liza Batkin: </strong>So, you were very skeptical that such a thing as “new feminism” exists— despite its being advertised at McNally Jackson’s, and on the back of Zambreno’s book…</p><p>And I was really interested in your idea that feminism suffers from a constant imperative for regeneration, for starting over— a damsel constantly in need of saving…</p><p><strong>Indiana Seresin: </strong>Yes. There’s a lot of denial of the history of feminism, and how movements have grown organically out of that history, have mutated. Even within feminism, there can be huge omissions and revisions of history. In any case, the use of “new feminism” by McNally Jackson and Semiotext(e) on the “Heroines” blurb just shows a lot of ignorance and narrowness of focus</p><p>And in some ways, maybe that narrowness is okay. I concede in my essay that there is kind of something, which we can call new feminism if we want although it’s really a completely absurd name, that appeals to a very particular market of mostly white, mostly straight, highly-educated literary women.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>But then it seems that this “new feminism” is reaching an audience of precisely the women who are least disabled by the forms of oppression that feminists feminists seek to attack?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, although sometimes I think there’s another side to that privilege–like with heterosexuality. I sense that a lot of what dominates “new feminism” is the struggle of being a heterosexual feminist. Of knowing  a lot of male “feminists” (not saying men cannot be feminist, of course, but I think we all know a male “feminist” when we see one). I think a by-product of third-wave feminism, especially how it has grown on the internet, is this idea that we should all be competing to be the most oppressed, and to care most about the most oppressed in this bizarre competitive way. But it’s often not this simple hierarchy of oppression.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I wonder if the “new feminism” that we need would focus less on vertical achievement— on breaking the glass ceiling— and more on horizontal achievement— on providing basic rights (reproductive rights, childcare, etc.) for more, if not all, women?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, perhaps. Honestly, it might be stupid to be lumping together all these people in this “new feminist” demographic that I’m basically making up. If we’re including people who like Chris Kraus… I really like Chris Kraus!</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>So you’re including Zambreno and Chris Kraus in this category?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, sort of. The demographic of new feminists I have seen it includes women on one end who actually might be very well versed in certain aspects of feminist theory but who nonetheless have a certain narrowness of perspective that would enable them to read “Heroines” as an unproblematically feminist text. On the other end of the spectrum as I see it, there are women writing on Tumblr, people who take Marie Calloway’s work seriously as feminist, which is more ridiculous to me.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Totally. It’s tricky, though, because on the one hand I think it’s good to make women conscious of and opinionated about their own identity politics– to make us think about what it means to be a woman in today’s society. And I think that it’s good that there is some venue for women to do something like “feminism” in a really approachable, swallowable way. But, of course, the value of this is undermined by the poor value of the feminist content that you often find in such venues.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes. It’s totally true that feminism should contain something different for everyone, and it should be culturally specific. What annoys me about someone like Marie Calloway, and the fact that Kate Zambreno wrote this article about her, is that these are women who I’m sure are capable of a much more sophisticated kind of feminism. This “fucked up girl” aesthetic that Zambreno writes about is just so teenagerish to me. There was that interesting article about the way young women and girls get involved with communities and stuff on Tumblr that encourage self-harm… (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/social-media-is-redefining-depression/280818/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/social-media-is-redefining-depression/280818/</a>)</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>The internet is incredibly powerful!</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>And it seems irresponsible (as well as just silly) for smart, grown-up women writers to be fetishizing that or celebrating it or even just approving it. It’s true that the internet is powerful, and I worry that as content becomes increasingly personalized the internet will turn on feminism, or fail it.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Because people will just have their own views reconfirmed. I mean this is already happening, and with all aspects of online content. The “silver bubble” thing.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>An interesting reversal or over-extension of “the personal is political.”</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes that’s true</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>What appear to be platforms for freedom and choice are actually just driving us further inwards and narrowing our vision.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yeah. So in that way I think feminism should maintain a very critical relationship to the internet.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>So I’m interested if you think there are any people today who write good and sophisticated culturally specific feminism, to recommend instead of Zambreno?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Do you mean on the internet or just in general?</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I guess in general— I mean, you mentioned your interest in Donna Haraway and bell hooks?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes. bell hooks is a good person to mention because although she’s an academic her work does not read as dry or overly scholarly. I already mentioned Hilton Als, who might not even explicitly identify as a feminist, and who says some strange and borderline misogynist things sometimes, but whose crazy and radical way of thinking about the world is really helpful to the kind of feminism I want to practice. There is a cool reclamation and re-celebration of the more interesting radical feminists––Shulamith Firestone, Ellen Willis––that’s going on right now that I think is great. Beatriz Preciado, I am reading her book now, “Testo Junkie: Sex, Drugs, and Biopolitcs in the Pharmacopornographic Era”. It is dazzling.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Great!
