He left the theater outraged. The version of <i>Shrek</i> that he saw had been dubbed in France and then imported to Quebec, something that rendered it incomprehensible to his and apparently many other children. The dub, it seemed, had been infected with Parisian slang and garbled by an unfamiliar accent, unpleasantly distinguishing it from the international French Quebecers have come to expect in films and television. At the center of a media frenzy, Dumont called for a radical solution. He proposed a bill that would “require all movies distributed in Quebec to be dubbed in Quebec, or not shown at all.”¹ </span><span class="s1">This bill did not pass.</span><span id="more-1706"></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"> One explanation for this proposal is that expanding the dubbing industry means expanding employment opportunities for Quebecers. Yet imagined profit can only account for so much of Dumot’s fervor and public response to him. Take a look at the practice of dubbing more globally. Consider, for a moment, some countries in which dubbing is the norm: Spain, Italy, and Germany. These countries all have large enough consumer bases to make dubbing, an expensive process, profitable. Yet profit does not explain why Catalonia, an autonomous community in Northeast Spain with a population slightly lower than that of New York City, regularly produces dubs in Catalan, a language spoken in the region, when 99% of its inhabitants could understand dubs in Castilian Spanish. (The government actually loses money yearly doing this.) It also does not explain why countries accustomed to dubs continue to prefer dubs while those accustomed to subtitles continue to prefer subtitles. Addressing this question, a 1991 translation studies article points out that the economic and political histories of dubbing countries may be the actual source of their practices.</span><span class="s1"> For the fascist governments that in the twentieth century variously controlled Italy, Germany, and Spain, having a single standardized language was a method of mass control and a point of national unity. In Spain, Franco attempted to eradicate minority languages. In Mussolini’s Italy, non-dubbed films were prohibited. Foreign (especially American) influences in media were strategically rejected for the sake of national unity. Dubbing became a propagandic way to repel outside culture while affirming the symbolic power of the national language.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"> Today, while no longer reeking of oppressive centralization and Fascism, nationalism and cultural protection continue to be compelling explanations for the quantity and diversity of dubs. A 2010 article on the situation in Quebec by Luise von Flotow, a specialist in problems of translation, reports that the labor union <i>Union des artistes </i>(UDA),</span></p><p class="p5"><span class="s1">wants to take control of both the language and timing of foreign films. There is nothing more ridiculous, they say, than to have North American realities interpreted for Québecers by expressions and accents from Paris…The debates around dubbing are thus in line with recent initiatives to protect cultural diversity in the francophone world, and which target the power and influence of globalized English-language products.²</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"> Elsewhere Von Flotow remarks that “when the UDA website asserts that “<i>on veut s’entendre</i>” [we want to hear ourselves], it means that ‘we’ do not want to hear English, and therefore subtitles are out of the question, and ‘we’ do not want to hear a French we do not speak either, a foreign version of our language.” ³ </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"> Unified language is of paramount concern to many countries and communities, especially as they try to stall the unrelenting influence of American media on their culture. Minority languages are no longer the menace, the homogenizing power of American media is. In Franco’s Spain, Catalan was banned. Now, in 2014, the Catalonian government has again modified its law on film dubbing, obligating American companies to dub 25% of their films exported to Catalonia in Catalan or face a fine. Controversy erupted. As always, the Catalan government reminded critics that Catalan is a co-official language with Spanish in the community of Catalonia. It has the right to be promoted too, doesn’t it?</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"> It’s not hard to see that Catalonia and Quebec’s efforts to protect their languages and Disney’s efforts to dub movies like <i>Frozen</i> in 41 languages and rely on the same principle: dubbing’s weird ability to make people feel like a movie was “made for” them. Both commercial and cultural pressures to dub reveal the total hypocrisy of any dub: it appears to facilitate connection with the culture shown in the film, while, in fact, aggressively promoting the culture of the language in which it is dubbed. This is why dubbing’s such a valuable political tool. It gives diverse cultures a voice, even if that voice is infelicitously shoved into others mouths. This is also why regional dubs are hotbeds for nationalist sentiments and international, supposedly neutral dubs are objects of deep resentment: Did the last Disney movie to bust your block give you a voice? Did it ignore the way you talk? Did it <i>distort</i> the way you talk? This time, were you left in or out?</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"> The world of dubbing is, in fact, a very lonely world to live in. This is why, hearing “Let It Go” for around the millionth time, I’m struck by the perspicuity of one of Elsa’s lines. “A kingdom of isolation,” she says as she looks around. <a href="http://theadvocateblog.net/2015/02/18/the-problem-of-dubbing-in-international-cinema-part-one/" title="Distortion: The Problem of Dubbing in International Cinema – Part One">“And it looks like I’m the queen.”</a></span></p><p class="p1" style="text-align:left;">Read Part One <a href="http://theadvocateblog.net/2015/02/18/the-problem-of-dubbing-in-international-cinema-part-one/" title="Distortion: The Problem of Dubbing in International Cinema – Part One">here.</a></p><p class="p1" style="text-align:left;">Read Part Two <a href="http://theadvocateblog.net/2015/03/26/distortion-the-problem-of-dubbing-in-international-cinema-part-two/" title="Distortion: The Problem of Dubbing in International Cinema – Part Two">here.</a></p><p class="p1" style="text-align:left;"><em>By Lucas Quatrecasas ’18</em></p><p class="p3">¹ Von Flotow, Luise. “June 2007: Quebec Politicians Debate a Bill to Impose Strict Controls on Audiovisual Translation, and Fail to Pass It.” 62-75.
