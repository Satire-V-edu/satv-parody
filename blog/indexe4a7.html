            <p class="post-teaser">Taken together, the first five lines of Vergil’s Eclogues are the most beautiful lines of poetry in the Latin language. It seems people don’t make claims like that very often anymore and, sometimes, I think that’s a shame.Why is it that translators are so often driven to attempt precisely those passages that seem so perfect in their original language, so untranslatable? Perhaps it is because translation feels most necessary when it is most impossible.I could say that I am drawn to translating these lines because they deal with the same issues facing a translator: the speaker, a herdsman named Meliboeus, is leaving his native land (and taking his song with him), while Tityrus creates an echo of his own voice, spreading his song at the risk of distortion. And it must be the image of the forest.</p>

Courtesy of www.themarkbradfordproject.orgThe Harvard Design School occupies the core of my mental campus map. Inside the efficient Bauhaus structure, I imagine, designers construct precise models for future spaces. They synthesize and restructure theories from around the university, as they fit them into physical frameworks of steel, Plexiglas, and wood.  Unlike most Harvardians, these academics make things. They belong to the real, physical world.At first, the recent exhibit at the Design School seemed to confirm this image.  Maps on walls and in display cases rendered spatial indicators—topography or population or climate—in aesthetically pleasing visual codes. Design students’ experiments in cartography shared space with gorgeous, abstract expressionist visions.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">On Saturday, November 3, Dan Chiasson and David Ferry read from their poetry and answered audience questions at the Advocate building on 21 South Street. The following is an event reflection by Advocate poetry board member, Kevin Hong ’15. “I actually died six weeks ago,” David Ferry said at lunch.We were sharing a combination platter at Café Algiers—Ferry, Dan Chiasson, and members of The Harvard Advocate. Ferry explained that his heart had stopped for a minute at a Brookline restaurant before a doctor resuscitated him. Chiasson’s brow furrowed and his eyes softened as Ferry went on: he returned to the restaurant to find out the name of the person who had saved him, and having obtained a name, wrote a “heartrendingly beautiful” letter to the man. (“Longhand?” Chiasson asked, impressed. Ferry is vivacious but admits to his physical frailty.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Published in The Harvard Advocate, Vol. II, No 3 (Oct. 26, 1866).
In October 1866, the editors of The Harvard Advocate decided it was time to address the subject of “love poetry.” Though the publication had been running for under a year, it had already disappointed dozens of swooning sonneteers with rejection letters. In the column reprinted above, the editors do their best to soothe these romantic spirits: it’s not you, they promise—it’s love that’s the problem. A timeless preoccupation, a “favorite” since ancient times, love (they say) is simply impossible to transcribe onto the pages of an undergraduate publication.The editors explain that love is an intricate and many-sided thing; however, they regret to announce, its best sides have already been taken. And while it is indisputably interesting, love is not contagious: those who remain outside of Cupid’s sway do not care to hear from his arrow-struck victims.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">The following lyric essay is an excerpt from a senior thesis in poetry by Advocate publisher and poetry board member Stephanie Newman ’13.I am walking back to my apartment. We are in Budapest. I come upon a man. He is sitting behind many rows of gleaming tall-stemmed crystal glasses. So many different heights. A garden. With his moistened fingertips, from glassrim to rim, he chimes his song. His melody attracts a crowd. Mostly foreigners who were sleeping the night away at hotels on the Danube embankment. Men and women, of uncertain age, dressed in evening clothes, looking at each other and smiling. The man behind the song? He plays his song so casually, evasively, as though no crowd were watching, or rather, perhaps, as though his nonchalance deflects attention. What he is making isn’t quite beautiful—too sprite, too high-pitched—but his offering is sent out into this night with an easy flourish.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">On October 25, 2012, The Harvard Advocate conducted an original interview with English novelist and critic Martin Amis. Amis has published numerous novels and collections of non-fiction, including The Rachel Papers, Money, and London Fields. His most recent book, Lionel Asbo: State of England, was released earlier this year. Below is an excerpt from the interview, the entirety of which will be published in the Advocate’s Winter 2013 print issue.The Harvard Advocate: Do you have any thoughts about the cultivation of writers? Should it be a collective activity? Should some people not become writers?Martin Amis: Well, it can’t be a cooperative activity. Writing is about solitude. To be a writer you have to not only have an enormous appetite for solitude, but you have to be in some sense most alive when alone.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Published in The Harvard Advocate, Vol. XCV, March 7, 1913Published in The Harvard Advocate, Vol. XCV, March 21, 1913The later poetry of Edward Estlin Cummings is instinctively recognizable to any lover of poetry. His page is a visual canvas, upon which words are not simply sounds that peal back to produce meaning, but aesthetic objects laid out upon the page.E.E. Cummings was born and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at 104 Irving Street, just a stone’s throw from Annenberg Hall – where Harvard’s freshman now dine. He was the son of a Harvard Professor – Edward Cummings – who had been one of the first Professors of Harvard’s burgeoning Sociology Department. Born and raised within the echoes of student’s footsteps as they rushed to class, Cummings would enter its gates as a freshman in September 1911, although he would continue to live at home until his Senior Year.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Mamma Jean’s home is an apartment in the city. The apartment is in a high rise of rental condominiums overlooking the beach, two blocks from a retirement community. She bought it when her husband died, years ago, as a big fuck you to widowhood and college students on spring break. The furniture is sparse; a stationary bike fills the space where a couch would sit. The TV loops continuously with 1950s Olympic cycling.It’s the place I go when I need to go some place else.I spent summers there once I was old enough to clean up after myself. Between her morning cycling and her evening cycling, she’d load me into her PT Cruiser and play taxi. “Play” is the term I used. The term she used was “moonlight.” She’d park on the corner of the bus stop near the local college and wait for disappointed summer-school girls, away from home and unaccustomed to public transportation, left behind by the 36 to Ocean Terminal.</p>
