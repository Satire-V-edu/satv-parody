The conversation doesn’t go well after that.  He had seemed approachable, standing with his back to the brick wall next to a smoke shop on Dorchester Street. Approachable in the sense that he wasn’t in a hurry, leaning back against that wall. I’d already been shut down by two potential interviewees: one a South Asian cashier in a corner store whose eyes grew suspicious the moment the word interview tumbled from my mouth, the other a man waiting for the bus by some empty Tyvek’ed building frames (“I’m just not sure I’ll have time to give you much of a story before it comes”). I wanted someone who had nowhere to go.  Wearing an old North Face fleece, he is unmoving despite the chill and slight flecks of wet snow falling; he has the caved-in mouth of someone who has lost a few teeth, but his eyes—blue and direct, clear—suggest he has some time to kill and no obvious antagonism toward strangers.</p>

Further information: sexual cannibalism

	Sexual cannibalism in Mantis religiosa
Sexual cannibalism in Mantis religiosa
Sexual cannibalism is common among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It has sometimes been observed in the field, where about a quarter of male-female encounters results in the males being eaten by the female.[43][44][45] Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism.[46] Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage,[5] possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males.[47]In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male’s being cannibalized increases cumulatively.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Like many unjustly marginal books, Helen DeWitt’s The Last Samurai is a novel that makes you want to proselytize. It makes you want to blog about it, laud it to your friends, brandish it in high-transit places in the hopes that another intrepid reader, impelled by the novel’s aura of genius, will come along and ask about it.It’s also a novel that rewards you for your efforts by not being impenetrable: risking unintelligibility only when necessary and avoiding an elliptical narrative in favor of chronological dullness, so that you’ll always be on solid footing, no matter how outré things get. (Depending on your tolerance, they get either over- or underwhelmingly outré.) It’s for this reason, I think, that The Last Samurai has survived fifteen years of abysmal levels of popularity with the general readership—DeWitt’s book is ultimately empowering and decidedly feel-good, leaving its readers with the sense that they’ve grasped a complicated whole, that they too can be as perceptive a reader as the precocious polymath/incorrigible linguistic dilettante at the novel’s center, Ludo, a really smart 11 year-old.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">I’m spending the summer after freshman year working in an old school surf shop in a small beach town in the South Bay, where I grew up. I work two days a week for minimum wage, and business varies— mostly slow in the afternoons, despite the droves of tourists who have discovered this idyllic pocket of suburban Los Angeles where my father, and his father, grew up. This summer is particularly hot; the kind of heat where you are only ever half-comfortable submerged in the ocean’s soft waves, watching the menacing heat shimmer far away on the on the volleyball courts where players dance, hopping from side to side as their feet burn. The beach is a block down from the storefront where I stand sweating, and sometimes I close the shop for half an hour in the middle of the day to cool off in the water, compelled by my merciless allegiance to the power of those waves.</p>

It’s my first summer living on my own – my first time doing all of the things that the incubator-esque housing system at my college guards against (i.e. paying for food and rent). And it has been marked by a distinct lack of green, both vegetal and fiscal. In the weeks leading up to my aunt’s wedding in Chicago, I look forward to it as my opportunity to go unapologetically all-out – to glory in the family maxim that states that ordinary eating outside one’s native zip code is impossible.For us, vacation eats are characterized by two forms of decadence: the Uber-fancy, and what my mom calls the “sick.” The former means maître d’s that probably object to whatever I chose to wear during the…View original post 1,380 more words

            <p class="post-teaser">Luís Buñuel’s last and possibly best film That Obscure Object of Desire, begins with a scene in which Mathieu, a grey-bearded, houndstooth-suited Frenchman, dumps a bucketful of water on the head of his young lover, Conchita, as she attempts to board a train on which he is fleeing from her. Apparently shocked and pathetically drenched, she stops chasing him. Mirroring the train’s inevitable progress toward its destination, a handful of flashbacks go by, and we learn that Conchita has been repeatedly goading Mathieu with sexual promises she doesn’t keep, turning him on and frustrating him in equal and increasing measure. She’s saving herself for marriage, she says; Ma thieu, thinking gratification is just around the corner, puts up with it. One night, he discovers Conchita performing some kind of strip-Flamenco for seedy tourists.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">About twenty minutes into the recently released David Foster Wallace biopic, The End of the Tour, the journalist David Lipsky, played by the appropriately leptosomic Jesse Eisenberg, eagerly (that is, enviously) questions Jason Segel’s DFW about the attendant benefits of his newfound fame. “This is nice,” Wallace responds, before adding, with a cryptic lack of emphasis, “This is not real.” In the years since his death, Wallace’s legacy has undergone countless metamorphoses, although the various threads of interpretation, for the most part, have remained discrete and self-contained, failing to interact with one another—and so it’s no wonder that a critical or popular consensus has yet to crystallize. For some, Wallace was a prophet of the internet age and the deleterious effects of hyper-connectivity.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">This image is taken from Brin-Jonathan Butler’s Twitter.Brin-Jonathan Butler is a journalist, sportswriter, filmmaker, and perennial boxer. His work has appeared in Vice, Deadspin, The Wall Street Journal, Salon, Harper’s, The Paris Review and The New York Times. Hee is the author of A Cuban Boxer’s Journey: Guillermo Rigondeaux, from Castro’s Traitor to American Champion and The Domino Diaries: My Decade Boxing with Olympic Champions and Chasing Hemingway’s Ghost in the Last Days of Castro’s Cuba. Largely composed of interviews he’s hustled into existence or conducted beyond the reach of Cuban state surveillance, his writing is a dense archive of opinions, witticisms, and commentaries on Cuban culture–its discontents, its happinesses, and its dazzling inconsistencies. He often describes Castro’s Cuba as “1984 if Charles Dickens had written it,” and in his experience, Olympic-grade boxers struggling to leave Cuba without trading in their Cubanness for international cash are some of the story’s most dogged protagonists.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Disruption is a series of digital images produced by a camera subjected to abrupt motion during exposure. The title describes the process of their creation, as well as their concern with the tension between the motion of the world and stillness of photography. The latter presumes to isolate an infinitesimal unit of time, yet is itself a continuum.The camera was focused on a particular element—in one case a face,  in another an architectural intersection. It was then accelerated rapidly alone one or more axes using a variety of mechanisms, such as levers and pulleys, in the window of time during which the image was captured.Disruption IDisruption IDisruption IIDisruption IIDisruption IIIDisruption III
