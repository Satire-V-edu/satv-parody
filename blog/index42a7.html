Image courtesy of www.speronewestwater.comAlex Wells: You talk of not seeing yourself in your early work, which reminded me of something you said earlier about your relationship to Australian authors, about not seeing your own work in theirs. Now, this is a large and existentially fraught question—especially if we accept the premise of Someone Else—but let’s give it a crack: How and why do you see yourself in the work of some and not others?John Hughes: It’s such a difficult question to answer, I think, because it’s really about what gets under your skin, isn’t it? What irritates you, what stimulates you—what gets in under there begins to take its own life within you.</p>

This month, we feature a series of short memoir posts centered on the theme Habit. Liza Batkin ’15, a regular contributor to Notes from 21 South Street, describes our vision for this theme below.

 We break them, develop them, build them unwittingly. They form the grooves that tunnel discretely beneath our feet and under our skin, directing our fingers, thoughts, and lips as we perform our daily tasks. They are the clandestine bureaucrats of our bodies and minds.Habits exist on every level of living. They span the two poles of the unacknowledged: from personal tics too small to notice to global patterns too large to consider. I close my eyes when I sneeze. I highlight and de-highlight text as I read on the computer screen. I wash my hair then face then body in the shower. I wave with my hand whenever I say “hi,” despite proximity.</p>

Image courtesy of http://www.wikipedia.orgThere was once a time, in high school, when I thought I might be an athlete. Cleaning out the attic the Christmas Break of my freshman year, I came  across a faded, musty photo of my great-uncle’s rowing team. They were all tall and toned and stared grimly at the camera, gripping their oars, their faces determinedly blank and pupil-less. The introductory meeting for my high school’s novice crew team was held at the boathouse down on Kelly Drive: dozens of similar photos cluttered the walls, sepia against wall-paneled oak. There is a quiet exclusivity to a sport that needs a river: I felt its tug of history and decided to enroll.The Schuylkill was our playing field, bordered by the Victorian gables of Boathouse Row that lit up at night like gingerbread houses.</p>

Here is a series of exquisite illustrations from the early days of this tradition.An illustration from the April 1939 issue.An illustration by Howard Turner from the April 1940 issue.An illustration of Picasso by Howard Turner from the March 1940 issue. The drawing, based on a photograph taken by Man Ray, was coupled with Turner’s critique on Picasso’s body of work. “We are not at present in much of a position to evaluate Picasso along with the great painters of the past,” says Tuner in his critique. “It remains, as always, for the future to pass judgment.”An illustration by Howard Turner from the June 1940 issue. The drawing accompanies a fiction piece titled “A Place in the Sunlamp.” A review of the 1940 issue by The Harvard Crimson comments on Turner’s process of illuminating a text: “There are certain obstacles as well as advantages which are peculiar to the short-story-illustrator.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">In February, Advocate member Alex Wells sat down with Australian writer John Hughes and recorded the following interview. Part I is published here: stay tuned for Part II. You can find John Hughes’s work published in the Advocate’s latest issue, Origin. Alex Wells: The two stories you’ve given us for the Origin issue come from your newest book, The Garden of Sorrows, a collection of reverse animal fables that will be published by University of Western Australia Publishing later this year. How did the idea for this project come about? John Hughes: The idea had been with me for quite some time. Largely, I think, it came about during the period when I was working on a couple of my earlier books, from experiences working in foreign countries where I wasn’t terribly familiar with the languages.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">In Werner Herzog’s wild film Aguirre: The Wrath of God, which we recently screened upstairs in the Advocate, the main man Aguirre goes mad in pursuit of the fabled city of gold, El Dorado. He co-opts a royal expedition on the Amazon and presses madly on down the river, drunk on pride and the scent of immortality.One scene brings a pair of natives to the raft; they have come to tell about a prophesy. But Aguirre sees a gold necklace on one of them, and loses his composure. Where did you get that? he growls with crazy eyes, Klaus Kinski eyes. Where does this gold come from?Aguirre’s madness is to go on downstream when there is nothing there but death. His madness is the promise of the origin, the mirage of a city that rises up out of a necklace. He assumes there has to be a single source. On and on downstream, the raft of Aguirre.</p>

Origin launches today; you can subscribe at www.theharvardadvocate.com. Learn more about O’Reilly’s photography at www.finbarr-oreilly.com.From 2,000 feet above the flats of Senegal’s Sine Saloum peninsula along Africa’s West coast, shallow circular holes scooped from the earth by salt miners resemble craters punched into a lunar landscape. Brackish water seeps into the troughs from the surrounding ocean and, tinted by bacteria, mirrors the midday sun in pools of red, yellow, blue and green — a jumbled planetary Damien Hirst spot painting.My vantage point is from an Ultralight “plane,” which is more like a bicycle with floppy canvas wings and a propeller on the nose.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">The history of photography in the Harvard Advocate is an ongoing and rich one, a confrontation of the enduring question: How does the image find its place in a literary magazine? To commemorate the launch of The Harvard Advocate’s Winter 2013 issue, “Origin,” we have traced the emergence and changing role of the image in the Advocate and the ways in which the photographic image has been read on the page.Although photography had emerged in print in the early twentieth century, photographs only first began to appear in the magazine during the fifties and sixties as illustrative content and as advertisements.  A portrait of T.S. Eliot was included in the centennial issue, used as a visual reference to one of the Advocate’s most esteemed alumni. All of these examples speak to the then secondary, supplementary nature of visual media to the magazine.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">In our fifth installation of Origin supplements, we present an excerpt from an interview with the Australian writer John Hughes. Hughes is the author of three books: a collection of autobiographical essays entitled The Idea of Home, a series of “fictional essays” inhabiting his various artistic influences under the title Someone Else, and a novel released last year called The Remnants. His latest work is a group of reversed animal fables, where Australian animals are turned into humans according to the human qualities they possess. The full interview, conducted by Alexander Wells ’13 , will be published on the blog in installments throughout the coming week. Two stories by John Hughes, “The Making of Sorrow” and “The Origin of Exile,” are featured in the Advocate’s winter issue.Australian writer John Hughes.</p>
