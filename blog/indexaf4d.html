            <p class="post-teaser">I’ve been told that I’m not a member of the Marblehead Yacht Club of Marblehead, Massachusetts. I’ve been told that my family doesn’t own a newly-finished and -floored home in Marblehead next door to the Moorings. And that I’ve never been to Marblehead at all. I’ve also been told how to sail, in that, I was taught. And if there’s one thing that I know about sailing, about Marblehead, about the Yacht club, and about the Mooring family, it’s that a sailboat only docks right into the mooring when the sail’s boom is aligned just right, and a sail’s boom has to be aligned just right, precise something fierce, to all them magnetic fields. No, they don’t call it a boom because it’s easy to align. And they don’t call them the Moorings because they’re poor. And you’ll never win the lottery by learning how to sail.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">The grass that once defined grassroots movements isn&#39;t so tangible anymore. It&#39;s been tainted and infected by the drop of technology that fell into our heartland. It’s rumbling with the end times and shaking like it could, an object with potential, a medium. These people haven&#39;t fallen into the computer, they have only brushed against it, and the radial line then extends into the physical world around them, the place that once defined them. These radial lines and radial men [1] start to carry thoughts beyond their own, their minds are unstable, shaking, and full of potential.Their disparate radial points converge into a circumference of a circle, a single voice, that of badness, that of Cain. Biblical anger and the inability to express oneself other than through murder. Cain’s rage. Racism and the conspiratorial wing of the Alt-Right is the radial man channeling the voice of Cain.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">2016 has been one of those years.            I remember having a similar feeling back in 2009. It was at a New Year Party my parents had forced me to join. I was a spongy middle schooler in the midst of despairing adults who had lost their jobs, their prospects for parenthood, their self-esteem after a divorce, but who somehow still found the irony in themselves to grit their teeth and celebrate the coming of another year.For them, 2010 seemed to present the possibility for actual happiness, and I, pubescent and confused, believed in the potential of a new decade. For me, 2009 hadn’t been all that bad, except for the fact that 8th grade had come for me with all its saturnian force. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that over the past year, everywhere I went I had unwittingly absorbed from each adult interaction a fraction of the weighty gloom the real world entrusts on Big Kids.</p>

Cool and dark and all bloated up with dreaming,   They shiver and palpitate a little, edges bleeding   Into each other as they list toward morning.     2  Blink and find yourself suspended  In the eye of a little yawning moon and a room   Gone purple with her sap.   Bare, bruising, and borne up by phantom limbs   That claw and caress in equal measure,   You teeter on the edge of some great vagueness.     3  Grope your way back to the bed gingerly,   Dawn ripe flesh is most sweet and permeable.  Light chinks blush in the far window, leaking silently  As something trembles beneath.   One body remains and it is not to be mistaken.   Wake now and determine.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">If watching TV was a sport, there was a time in my life in which I would have qualified for  Olympic gold. When I was about nine years old I spent more time watching TV than most people spend working. I can recite the first episode of Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy verbatim. I can name so many characters from The Fairly Oddparents that it’s slightly disturbing. I know enough commercial jingles to fill a jukebox.	My taste in TV was completely indiscriminate—I watched everything from Thomas the Tank Engine to Wife Swap. Unwrapped and The Barefoot Contessa on the Food Network. Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide and George Lopez on Nick at Nite. Both American and Japanese versions of Ninja Warrior. That one game show where you get cash prizes for trying to put your body through increasingly small holes in sheets of foam.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Bret Easton Ellis’ characters are
sexy, but they also wear cool stuff. Here are 37 (perhaps every; it’s a non-exhaustive study) instances of sentences in which character(s) are
introduced into a scene along with a description of their outfit(s) in his debut
novel, Less Than Zero. This is like
one of those great street style articles on Refinery29
that can yield 40 unique page lands in the course of one article with word
count ~ 500. Or an exposé of the
stupidity of some sort of sartorial physiognomy. Nevertheless, feast your eyes
on some sweet word threads. Emphasis on any mention of rock-T’s. They’re hot
again.[Page citations from “First Vintage Contemporaries Edition,&quot; June 1998]Not the stain on the arm of the wrinkled, damp shirt I wear, a shirt which had looked fresh and clean this morning.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">My family had a room that was referred to exclusively as the Den. It was notable for three reasons. It contained the only couch we owned that it was o.k. to spill fluids on (it was purple leather but already scarred white from the scraping of sixty different hangnails, plus the more trimmed twenty of our parents). That couch was in that same place prior to my conception and has not moved in twenty-one years. Imagine standing still this whole time.There was also, depending on exactly when we are talking about, any given one of the three different televisions of those two decades. I would say each one lasted almost exactly seven years, but the one in the middle (a large silver cube with a perfectly square button) is to this day the only one I knew how to operate. There were also the two masks my parents brought back from Papua New-Guinea.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Three nights ago, I was sitting at the corner table of my high school friend’s yellow-lit kitchen –– he was the high school friend whose house always served as the default place to hang, a default we default to even four years out of high school –– playing Hearts. In the background of our card game, as each of us tried and failed to “shoot the moon,” a tinny cellphone speaker squeaked out the most persistent &amp; divisive Christmas song of all time. The song in question is, of course, “Last Christmas,” by the 80’s music duo Wham!, one half of whom is George Michael, namesake to Michael Cera’s character in Arrested Development and the most recent in a line of beloved figures to have passed away during 2016.“Last Christmas” is one of those seasonal songs on which everyone seems to have an opinion, no one of which is exactly the same.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">1. The revelation of a significant duality in the power of TV’s fictive constructions was a shocking component of this year’s political cycle. The televisual realm seamlessly deluded a mass population, assuring to its sheep the reality of an idyllic and pastoral fiction, while simultaneously transposing a didactically normative televisual fiction into the real through a reality TV star’s cult of personality. Even in the age of the Internet’s landless sprawl, the television sits slyly, still, on its quiet throne. One is now prompted with a necessity yet unseen in this new century to consider both the positive and negative implications to subscription or flight from the televisual system.    2. For years now, I have harbored an addiction to cooking television, watching with rapt attention as scores of ‘cheftestants’ (© Bravo?) try their hands at organized competition, vying for their chance to prove themselves The Best before the eyes of the public, who are taught to adore the wild dances that grace the flickering screen.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">When you talk about tarot the first thing anyone asks is whether you believe in it. By &quot;it&quot; they mean the alleged proclivity of the deck to arrange itself in such an order as to portray what’s coming for us. Or moreover, if I’m the one shuffling, the ability of my own fingers to fumble in just the right way to land the cards in the prescient order.We, the educated, know it’s just pseudoscience, right? If you want the cards to say, “Hey so, next Tuesday the 11th, you’re going to suffer a brain aneurism. Sorry about that,” then you’ll likely be disappointed. In 2013 a study demonstrated that the less one feels control over her life, the more likely she is to believe in precognition. You say you believe in this stuff and people either think you’re stupid or playing at personal mystique.On the farm my friend and I used to sit in an old trailer and read each other’s tarot late into the night.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Richard Rosen’s “Metaphors of a Cultural Radical,” from the December 1969 issue of the Harvard Advocate, seethes with a brand of rage that feels both relevant and naïve, alternately violently precise and hopelessly scattered. Rosen, a twenty year-old sophomore, was terrified by the institutional violence he witnessed first-hand in the preceding two years, both in his native Chicago at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and at Harvard during the spring 1969 student strike. Rosen, who worked with Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell during his time as an undergraduate, has gone on to write a number of humor books, histories, and sports articles. In reading his revolutionary words—he curses corporate culture and aesthetics, sees President Pusey’s face superimposed on that of every chauvinistic cop-pig, and dreams of a world in which cultural appreciation, rather than the profit motive, might finally win out.</p>

Rough and tumble slopes and  Lemonade stands where  I am not so tired as this  Yet. Not yet.    Bill,    Will you call?  We’d all like to see you very much.  All drive down with a cake and  Party hats and say what is    Drifting. How’s Suzy?  Did she and he ever?  That might have been nice.    I’m going crazy Bill,  Between these              walls.  And I hear the               scuttle  Of lives lived in the floorboards.  Taptap. Beat. Stop. Rest. Taptap. Taptap.    Rustling the dust.    And the roar is deafening.  The roar is deafening.    Don’t worry Bill, I don’t  Blame you. Life gets to be a bit  Much. Sometimes.  In watercolour.    I’ll be better      soon.</p>
