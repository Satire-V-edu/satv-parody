            <p class="post-teaser">It was raining when Rachel learned she would never become pregnant. She preferred to look at
the rain instead of the fluorescent light of the doctor’s office, the syringes, the biohazard signs,
letting the doctor’s monotone and the grind of water pellets hitting the window become white
noise. Her mom was in the corner. Her eyes said “Sorry, honey,” but her lips were pursed,
silently saying “Shit. Shit. Shit.”!
Physically, nothing had changed. Rachel could not carry a child because she was a child
herself. But she had wanted to have a child, eventually, in the abstract, like how a kindergartner
wants to be an astronaut. She smiled in spite of herself when toddlers stumbled by and picked
out her favorite names names like Tessa and Grace that she would save for future reference.
She knew that soon she would get older, and she would lengthen while her hips widened, and
then she would get older, and she would find herself cutting the crust off sandwiches, driving
other, smaller bodies to soccer practice or gymnastics or violin, and then she would get older,
and her body would be folding into itself, barren again.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Several members of my maternal family have settled on a single, dirt road in Wallace, South Carolina— a rural township about forty-five minutes from Charlotte.  My great-grandmother ‘s lot stands right at the turnoff from the interstate. If you start there and walk in a straight line, you’ll come across my aunt’s expansive yard, my cousins’ house propped up on wooden slats, and, at the edge of a forest, you’ll end up where we bury our dead, a clearing thick with yarrow weeds and marble. This narrow road, and the little world that radiates from it, extends for about a mile.    Edward P. Jones’s The Known World (2000) is firmly rooted in a similar space, where geography—physical, political, and social—conspires to shape the lives and relationships of its occupants. A work of historical fiction, The Known World is set on and around a Black owned plantation in the fictional Manchester County, Virginia.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">I like to apply metaphors of digestion to reading: indigestion, malnutrition, excretion, rumination. Word salad goes down like real salad. When we were kids most of us wanted to be the carnivorous animals that stalked our prey, sprinted in for the kill, ripped limb from limb and swallowed whole. Russian has a single adverb that encompasses the notion of consuming something&#39;s entirety with a single gulp. Satisfaction is implied.    This is how I wanted to read: to salivate, devour, and then laze around not thinking about my stomach until the next gazelle turned up. Yet as much as I eye ungulates, I&#39;m really just a large hunk of cow flesh chewing on the grass. The grass where I am always tastes like shit but the foliage over there looks damn fine. I move over there. It&#39;s not. I need six hours a day to pick up a measly twenty-four pounds of grass.</p>

The &quot;Summer Reads&quot; series features just a few of the very best things we read during our time apart.    It took us an hour to get the bonfire going at my friend Fred’s house on one of my first nights back in town for summer vacation. A few others made a delicious tray of Texas Toast to pass the time, and we somehow fell into an intense discussion about theoretical physics, something that none of us specialize in by any means. It all led to one great book recommendation, however. In the veins of the morals of both personal and scientific evolution, &quot;Children of the Sun: A History of Humanity’s Unappeasable Appetite for Energy&quot; by Afred W. Crosby is an illuminating and eternally relevant read. It’s not the sort of book I would have likely chosen for myself, but I am much more apt to give a chance to anything coming directly from a friend’s bookshelf.</p>

The &quot;Summer Reads&quot; series features just a few of the very best things we read during our time apart.My copy of Virginia Woolf’s “To the Lighthouse” is damp. It’s not because of the monsoon rains that haven’t let up for two months here, or because of the fetid humidity of my rented room. The book is soaked with sweat and acid rain. Here in Mumbai, the local train is the fastest way to travel. It also is full beyond bursting for most of the day. Full enough that I stood last night with my back against the metal partition of the train compartment, one man’s armpit breaking all Geneva Convention and all relevant regulation and inflicting a sweat-based “Chinese” water torture on Woolf’s masterpiece, another man’s umbrella hanging pendulous in front of my left eye, streaming (like consciousness, get it?) grey rain on a page of Mr.</p>

The &quot;Summer Reads&quot; series features just a few of the very best things we read during our time apart.Twelve is the book I’ve read most recently, which I heard about from a profile of its author in NY Mag. Twelve’s contents and the circumstances surrounding its publishing were perfectly engineered Literary Event fodder. The author was only 17, born and raised in New York, attendant of New York private schools, the son of a figure in the New York publishing industry. The book itself is a fast-paced, violent, druggy story that skewers the same set of rich kids that the author likely ran with.I can’t recommend reading Twelve on its literary merit, or even on the fact that it’s that good – in fact it’s often flinchingly bad. Yet, in both the circumstances of the book’s publishing and its execution, there is an unintentional narrative about the mythos that bombards a certain type of New York adolescent and how they turn around and refract that mythos.</p>

We live vigorously, we fail spectacularly, and, of course, we read ravenously. The next posts feature just a few of the very best things we read over the summer.Frog by Mo YanAnother of Mo Yan’s surreal and devastating novels that whirl through the Cultural Revolution and settle in its traumatized, guilty, capitalist aftermath, Frog is composed of letters written to fictional Japanese author Sugitani Yoshihito by a narrator who calls himself Tadpole. We begin with a scene from Tadpole’s starving childhood in China’s 1960s famine, so hungry he and his classmates fall upon a shipment of coal and start eating its shiny black rocks.</p>

lives, our surroundings will begin to change. The surreal and the unreal begin to emerge in the realm of
possibility. Media can be anything, mean anything, once software can shape our reality. Aeolian Processes
explores the potential for &quot;terraforming&quot; our natural world through augmented reality. Taking satellite
imagery of a particular type of martian landscapes (aeolian processes ­ &quot;sand dunes&quot;) , new, foreign terrain
is created in 3D with webGL and superimposed into our natural environment. Suddenly, with this new earth
breathing right in front of you, with these otherworldly sounds filling your ears, alongside recognizable
scenery, the surreal doesn&#39;t seem too far from reality.</p>

I have had a career as a successful corporate lawyer, working in New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Houston, and Beijing. 	I have, since my years at Harvard, never lived in the hot house that is Cambridge. So I have followed from afar the activities at Harvard.	What I have always noted is that Harvard leads from behind. It is never the initiator of progress or justice. But when something becomes the vox populi, à la mode, or to use that horrid new abbreviation, “PC”, Harvard pursues it with a ruthlessness which only massive wealth can underwrite.	Harvard rules by terror. That is amply demonstrated by William Wright’s book which only came out in 2005: Harvard’s Secret Court: The Savage 1920 Purge of Campus Homosexuals, which describes the surveillance and prosecution in in-house “trials” of gay students.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">For my upcoming show, I have created a piece just for you. It is intimate and personal. When you come to the wing of the museum where I have installed my work, you sheepishly pick up a program and hurry in. There is no one else here. They know this show is for you, and will be kind enough to leave you alone with it.  You pass into a great marble atrium. It is cool and grey and smells like wet rocks. Everyone you have ever known is facing you. They are not moving or even breathing, but they are looking at you. Your high school english teacher is looking at you kindly. Your sixth grade crush is looking at you kindly. The kid you babysat a couple times when you needed pocket money in college is looking at you kindly.   You duck behind a black curtain into a tiny dark room where a film plays. In the film, your first love is speaking, looking you right in the eye.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">In anticipation of the coming DANGER issue, we reintroduce the Symposium—a collection of artistic creation centering on a single topic. This month, Ariana Chaivaranon, Owen Ojo, Francesca Violich, and Sarah Toomey contemplate “Danger.”



ONE



&quot;Wait&quot; is part of a series of paintings that place figures within a narrative of death. This series, painted on loose canvas, is tacked directly to the wall of the exhibition space, lending a rough immediacy and implying transience. The subjects are dislocated from the time and space they occupy through the use of distinct coloring and paint application between the figure and ground. Both the formal elements and the narrative of the piece play to the disturbance of the viewer.

            <p class="post-teaser">Does God exist? Fuck if I know. I gave up on the Catholic Church at fifteen after seeing Jesus Christ Superstar. Christ was a megalomaniac, and I wanted to do Mary Magdalene. But I’m holding out hope for the hereafter. This week, the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics (HCHAA) has invited me and my two lady Roommates to their meeting, to drink wine which ostensibly has little relationship to Christ’s blood and to talk about God, or the lack thereof. Atheists like wine because they don’t have spirits.André Extra Dry: “crisp with notes of apple and citrus” (“Egregiously a little over four dollars,” says my host)André is like my sophomore year sex life: Sweet, dependable, and utterly unthrilling. Its bubbles go straight to my head in a sorry attempt to sweep me off my feet, but I am merely left headachy.</p>
