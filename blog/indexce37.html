In mere seconds I am handed a ticket — an old fashioned, receipt-paper square that leaves a slightly chalky residue on my fingers — marked for the film I hadn’t even had time to indicate. His wry smile betrays amusement at the reason he had guessed my order — the string of college-aged customers who had arrived for the same purpose, the 8:30 pm showing of this year’s Cannes Palme d’Or winner.Rather than pirating an illicit copy for private viewing like fifth-graders at a sleepover secreting an R-rated movie in a duffel bag, as we might have in another time and place, my friends and I were received at Blue is the Warmest Color without question or controversy.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">The November 1951 issue of The Devil's Advocate addressed a single theme: William Faulkner. Reviews, essays, and excerpts from dissertations crowded the now-yellowed pages of the magazine, tackling everything from the author’s novels to his childhood. Two names in particular jump out from the list of contributors: Albert Camus and Thomas Mann. The Advocate editors were eager to milk this literary windfall, placing their names in bold print on the cover of the issue, and noting their “gracious acknowledgment” to contributors including Camus and Mann “for making this issue possible.” In the Contributors’ Notes, the two are described as follows:“ALBERT CAMUS, possibly France’s leading contemporary novelist, has seen his novel The Plague translated into nearly every modern language. A critic as well as a novelist, M.</p>

Last week, she recorded the final essay of her book for Notes from 21 South Street. I followed the reading with several questions, which were formulated by Victoria Baena ’14 and myself. I hope you enjoy “The Washing Room II” and the following interview.– Kevin Hong ’15Harvard Advocate: Why did you choose to write in vignettes?My Ngoc To: I think it’s because it was the structure that best portrayed my story. Because there wasn’t one large story that could describe what I was going through, I wanted each story to focus on a different part of my life. And not even my life, but other people’s lives. I feel like The Washing Room is not something that happens once, or that you can follow with a line.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser"> Consider Sisyphus, brushing the dust across his bruised ribs, sighing curselessly as Zeus’s impossible rock thumps again down that clay hill in Corinth. Imagine how the old king takes his time coming down to meet the stone, how the rock must wait while he, without worry, may keep to a gentle descent, even pausing when appropriate to lookout below. Think of the view from the top: the whole world pressed into flatiron plains. There, below are the bluegrass fields where in early October boys run wind sprints past the line between the swing-gate and shed, where cleats catch mud in solemn ritual, and where young rushing bodies smash young rushing bodies and footballs are tucked underarm. There, even farther, is the hill that you and I used ascend every day in autumn, attempting to catch sight of eggs hatching in the chickadees’ nest; and there are the tracks, ridged over lopped stems from the mower that one day minced grass with eggshells.</p>

Image courtesy of Christina Davis“Now I’m in the limelight ‘cause I rhyme tight / Time to get paid blow up like the World Trade,” raps the Notorious B.I.G. on hit track “Juicy” from his debut album Ready to Die. On October 10, poet and scholar Dorothea Lasky traced the pervasive braggadocio of hip hop — epitomized by Biggie Smalls — back to the great poets of the U.S. and Ancient Rome, touching on Catullus, Sylvia Plath, Kanye West, Bernadette Mayer, Horace and Nikki Minaj, among other wordsmiths, along the way. Lasky’s lecture, “Poetry and the Metaphysical ‘I’”, focused on the transcendent speaker that can shed identity and slip into any outfit.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Earlier this semester, I had the pleasure of interviewing Nico Schwalbe, guitarist and lead singer of the band L.A. Jeff. We met at Café Gato Rojo to discuss psychedelia, Harvardiana, and miscellanea. The following is a transcription of the parts of our conversation I deemed blog-appropriate. You can hear L.A. Jeff live this Saturday, October 19, 9 pm, at 21 South Street. – Kevin Hong ’15Kevin Hong: Where are you guys from?Nico Schwalbe: I was actually born in L.A., but I grew up in France. Parker is from here, Will is from NorCal, Sam is from England and Saman is from New York, but his family is from Iran. So we’re really from all over the place, which is somewhat unusual since bands so often form in these local microcosms.KH: What was your previous band name?NS: Lunar Volk, which is the name of our EP now.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">As we usher in a new theme, hat trick, it seems only fitting to take a look back at “Hat Trick,” a seemingly lighthearted piece published in December of 1977. According to the information about contributors for the issue, the author, Alice Weil, was “a junior in the writing option.”Weil’s prose piece traces exchanges of flowers through two phases of the narrator’s life, both before and during college. When Rachel finds herself in Cambridge, she meets Jeff. Jeff at the time “didn’t have a beard, but he was still tall and imposing in the style that strikes you either as alluring or ridiculous.” Jeff and Rachel share a night together, but fail to fully define their relationship. On her twentieth birthday of that year, she receives three gifts from three friends: a heather plant, a forsythia branch, and a bouquet of daisies and jonquils.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Image courtesy of liaudetlithographiesMembers of The Devil's Advocate riff on the first theme of the year, Hat Trick. Business member Calvin Willett ’16 gives us an introduction.As with most slang, the origin story of the phrase “hat trick” is mostly apocryphal.  Most sources though, including the OED and user SeniorMoments of www.funtrivia.com, seem to indicate it originates from English cricket in the late 19th century.  Supposedly, on a green day, a bowler knocked down three consecutive wickets – a feat, I am told – and the crowd took up a collection, using the proceeds to buy him a hat.This is a charming tale, and I imagine all of the chimney-sweeps involved were quite pleased. But at Notes from 21 South Street, we’ve chosen “Hat Trick” for more than a cricket-themed set of pieces. For two fortnights, our aim is gasps, sparks, confusion, applause, and the return of the world to its Natural Order.</p>

Every time I do this, I get an eyebrow raise, right when it cracks.”“What do I do after?”“We’ll give you directions written down. People tend not to remember what I’m saying right now, because they’re nervous.”“Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Can we just, like, do it now?”“Yes, absolutely. Let me go wash my hands.”I take out headphones and start listening to Bon Iver in one ear.After a minute: “Ready?”“Yeah.”“First we’re going to get you nice and numbed up. We’ll give you plenty of stuff, and then we’ll still check afterward. I know that’s something lots of folks are afraid of, feeling the surgery.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">The winter issue of the one hundred and twenty-seventh volume of The Devil's Advocate features six artworks, all of them photographs. The last of the six, printed on the last page, rises upward out of the magazine, monumental in form and content.The midday sun of the photograph divides the stone into distinct and overlapping geometries, the shadows reaching downward to draw apart granite from sky. In the glare the grain speckles the surface with a constellation of pits and grooves. Three long triangles slice downward, as if above some unseen force has driven stakes deep into the frame. Blunted, tapering columns surge into the remaining space; what they support is unclear. The photographer has composed this shot with care, taking pains to decontextualize the object and revel in its form. Like a photograph of a naked torso, it is difficult to reconstruct a head and legs, though the imagination does so anyway.</p>
