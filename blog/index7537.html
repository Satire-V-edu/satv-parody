            <p class="post-teaser">The Brooklyn dockworker proles of On the Waterfront are D-and-D: “deaf and dumb.” They don’t hear nothing and they don’t say nothing, because they know that mob boss Johnny Friendly has a passion for shooting canaries. The system changes when luckless former boxer Terry Malloy—we know him as Marlon Brando—decides to testify against Friendly in court. That leads to the death of Brando’s brother, to Brando’s own unemployment, and to a near-death encounter at the fists of Friendly’s goons.We love Brando for this self-sacrifice. But what makes it the right thing to do? Jonathan Sacks, a rabbi and British parliamentarian, thinks he knows the answer. Like many sociobiology evangelists, Sacks believes that a potent brew of neurobiology, game theory, and natural selection can furnish us with a vindication of the human appetites for religion and altruism.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">We went to the theater last week. On a Sunday evening, cold, to see a play my mother had read about in the Tribune and later termed The Show That Had That Scene With The Naked Guy. It had other merits, of course, like an onstage pool of water and literary references, but when we stepped into the elevator with no one else around she looked down, shaking her head: “I just don’t know why he was naked.”It was the aggressive sexuality of it all, the nude’s lack of subtlety, that made her so uncomfortable—but there was something else, maybe. He was so transparent up on the stage. There he was, all of him. His heart-shaped birthmark, usually tucked into his trousers like a piece of gum stuck between the leaves of a napkin, breathed free instead under hot lights. She felt, I think, like a voyeur.“Mom, push the button,” my sister nudged.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">The translator’s preface is a curious genre.  I learned this as I studied it this fall for a translation project of my own, a translation of Austrian modernist Robert Musil’s novella Die Vollendung der Liebe.  Although the translator’s preface is not as well-recognized as the sonnet or the sestina, it has a fixed form.  First, the translator introduces the life of the author, often writing paeans to the author’s brilliance—which in reality justifies the translator’s present work.  With this bit of sorcery, the translation borrows the radiance of the original work, like a moon reflecting a sun without producing any light of its own, and the translator’s preface can avoid the real question: what necessitates the translation itself, as an original work?  The next part of the preface shows how the translator tried her best to polish the translation into a perfect mirror reflecting back all the light of the original; but because of the laws of optics, some of the light incident upon that mirror, inevitably, was lost.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">It’s showtime.Well, the show has begun, but I remain as immobile as the audience members looking expectantly at me. The show is Stravinsky’s L’Histoire du Soldat, and I am the Princess. I spend the first half of the hour-long performance sitting profile to the audience, my back resting against the stage-left wall, my face wearing a pout fit for a paralyzed princess. I remain woefully comatose until a dashing young soldier arrives to rouse me with his fiddle.With my body at rest, my eyes roam freely about the theater. Sometimes I watch the show that unfolds before me, the very show I will soon enter, whose plot I will complicate, whose characters I will confront. Sometimes I watch Stravinsky’s music swim about the theater, over the balcony, between seats, upward towards the impossibly high, arched ceiling.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">The lights dim, voices hush. The stuffy indoor air is loaded with the weight of awaiting. Across the scarlet curtain they are frantic, harried, rushed. They dab on one last layer of beige powdered mask. They look into the mirror and at once they see another face. It’s happened before—it happens every night and twice on Sundays—but it’s always a procedure. Costumes on, stage positions set, poses at the ready, the lights go out and the curtain is drawn back. It’s showtime.From the heat of Fever we’ll move, this month, to the beam of the show. Our posts will broach the thrill of acting and the beat of performance. The heady pleasure of cosmetics in disguising a face—the tiers of fabric swathing a body—the lingering note of a final score—are heaved onto the stage for the taking. In our reach, theater is on an equal footing with theatricality.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">“I’ve never been interested or impressed by evil itself, but I have been confounded by how attractive it is to others, and stunned by the attention given to its every whisper, its every shout. Evil has a blockbuster audience, while goodness lurks backstage.”-Toni MorrisonSuch was the gilded tone and subject matter that enthralled attendees of Morrison’s Ingersoll Lecture at Harvard last week, in a talk entitled, “Goodness: Altruism and the Literary Imagination.” While she began by detailing a moving instance of human altruism and her resulting investigation into its scientific routes, Morrison quickly turned her attention to how goodness and its antithesis are represented in literature. Her thesis focused on the worrisome obsession with “evil” in modern texts: a fixation that, she claimed, renders wickedness in great complexity and depth.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">Published in The Harvard Advocate, Vol. XXVIII, No. 3 (Oct. 17, 1879).Theodore Roosevelt ’80 reflects on the intercollegiate context of Harvard football in a short contribution to the October 17, 1879, edition of The Harvard Advocate. He was an editor at the time.The rugged individualism that would later define Roosevelt, the trust-busting, rhino-slaying, Bull-Moose president, already shines through in his repeated appeals to the unmatched potential of hard work. “Nothing but very hard work will enable our men to win the victory,” he declares, the first word almost spontaneously italicizing under its own stately weight.Whether Roosevelt’s “hearty praise” made a lasting contribution to the Crimson’s spirit is lost to history; later in 1879, the team began an ambivalent streak of eight ties against Yale.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">That was a winter of fire alarms. Smoke set off the blare one afternoon in mid-February, shrieks bouncing through the halls of my small-town high school as we exited, half-costumed, onto the frozen grass. Our science-teacher-cum-set-designer had decided that burning bamboo poles for our South Pacific set was a good idea. The strobes flashing from the walls when the warning system smelled smoke told him otherwise.Something in my father’s heart wasn’t working right. Until that afternoon, we didn’t know it. Even when my mother tried to call me six or seven times to tell me about the ambulance, that tests had found something serious and they were rushing him to the hospital, the fire alarm swallowed up my ringtone’s harsh jangle. I didn’t see the missed calls until after the belching red trucks had pulled away.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">You might not know what salivary glands are, or that you have two, one on either side of your face. Put your fingers on the line of your jaw under your ear, and now move them towards your nose a little. What you are touching under the skin — that tough tissue — those are salivary glands.I didn’t know I had salivary glands either until I contracted an infection in Berlin that caused them to swell up like hard balloons. My friend got it first; we were having dinner in our small apartment when she lay down on the ground and stopped moving. We didn’t have a thermometer, so all I knew was that her forehead singed my fingers when I touched it, and that her eyes were kind of blank. But we were sixteen, invincible, broke, and living an adventure in a foreign city. We had no guide book, no Internet, and no knowledge of an equivalent to 911 (nor knowledge that 911 works anywhere).</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">The weather in Scotland is far from feverish. Clouds bristle, bulging in flocks along the tops of barren peaks. Houses and lampposts are swept into grey shadows. People grow smaller as they walk along the streets. Limbs fold in on themselves to brace against the rain. I used to imagine the sullen inhabitants of grey brick houses being swallowed up by their stone floors and heavy wood doors. I remember how harsh accents would rip the wind in my ears.I am eight years old and am standing on the edge of a beach in Eastern Scotland. Cliffs cut harshly into rough sea. The sky is low, oppressive. I am wearing lime green leggings and small white trainers. The trainers used to flash brightly when slammed down, but now they only flicker wanly. I am trying to revive them, slamming my heels roughly on the pebbled beach.</p>
