            <p class="post-teaser">“I don’t even know what I just saw” says Doc Sportello (played by Joaquin Phoenix) as he stares out into the misty California evening, obscured by stale joint smoke and the thick Los Angeles fog.  Beyond the haze lies the South Los Angeles shoreline and the enigmatic “Golden Fang,” a ship bearing heroin from the Golden Triangle. At about this time the viewer thinks, “I’m right there with ya, Doc.”Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of Pynchon’s Inherent Vice, stays true its source… what that means is the plot is  winding, disorienting, and labyrinthine, supersaturated with one-liners and surrealist gags. It is a unique, albeit polarizing, experience. Anderson’s undertaking is certainly bold and Inherent Vice is not without its critics, who claim the film is languid at best and incoherent at worst.</p>

In anticipation of the issue’s imminent arrival, features board members Indiana Seresin ’15, Faye Zhang ’17, Caleb Lewis ’17, and Lily Scherlis ’18, sat down with outgoing president Julian Lucas ’15, for a discussion centering on their nonfiction contributions to the magazine, and the many avatars of possession analyzed therein. Below find an abridged transcript of the first of this two-part conversation, in which Seresin’s “A Love Letter to My Stepmom,” and Scherlis’ “Their Party,” are considered. In part two, the group will discuss Lewis’ “When the Mammy Sphinx Gawks Back at You!” and Zhang’s, “Full Circle: (Exotic) Odysseys Through (Oriental) Rainforests on (Outlawed) Tour Buses.”Caleb Lewis: Let’s talk first about Indiana’s piece, “A Love Letter to My Stepmom.</p>

It is perhaps because art-making is necessarily a deeply personal practice; understanding an artist’s body of work in its entirety requires that we put him in the context of history, in relation to the city that he lived and worked, the people that he conversed with, and the works of art from which he drew inspiration. Naturally it’s difficult to pin down the factors that transformed artists as who they are now. The cliché that each human being brings a universe of his own resonates profoundly with artists. But if art-making is a personal pursuit in the end, where one has to carve his own path for creativity, what does it mean to study art in an institutional setting? Can art be taught?
Berlin-based artist Matt Saunders thinks so.</p>

Farther south on the same continent, Elsa continues to make it snow, but her voice is now that of the Spanish singer Gisela, who proclaims either “suéltalo!” (literally “let it go” in Spanish) or, in the Catalan version that Gisela also sings, “vol volar” (a slightly riskier translation meaning “it wants to fly”).Traveling east, Elsa’s Italian “Io lo so, sì, lo so” perfectly matches “let it go” in rhyme and prosody.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">On January 31, in two short afternoon hours, a group of students created a work of art.The Mather Build arose from the desire to play with Mather’s Three Columns Gallery. It’s a strange space that is frequently ignored: its function as a gallery is overridden by its main function as Mather’s lobby. The space’s weirdness is dulled by the routine of the hundreds of students who walk through it every day.Recognizing the gallery’s transitory nature, artist Matthew Terry and Harvard senior Kevin Hong decided to employ materials (gauze, paper, wire, rope, wood) that would engage ideas of transience and permanence, transparency and opacity. Collaborating with nine students, and adopting Thomas Hirschhorn’s motto, Energy: Yes! Quality: No!, several works were created that respond to the unique qualities of the gallery itself: its open airspace, its whiteness, its pock-marked columns, its concreteness.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">I sometimes tell people that at school I am a de facto vegetarian. The meat entrees aren’t great, and with a salad bar, cereal dispensers, and frozen yogurt machine at my disposal, I do not often feel compelled to wait five to fifteen minutes for a grill order. Things change during the summer. My family eats a lot of chicken and seafood; I eat out more. Red meat, however, continues to account for a negligible percentage of my diet. It’s not that I dislike red meat; I just tend not to seek it out. I’ll order a lightweight red meat appetizer (steak tartare anyone?) but, for me, if a porterhouse is on the menu it might as well not be.This past month, however, I visited rural Colorado. I was there for eight days, including one night in Denver, and I ate red meat on every single one of them.Day one was beef cheek at The Squeaky Bean.</p>

On one snowless December night, the moment arrived, fairytale-like, just before midnight. The last spoonful of salsa scooped, my coat buttoned, the hostess thanked, my exit was only halted by the call of one or two (gender-neutral) princes—“We have to discuss Serial!”There was nothing to do but stay and form a small circle of devotees, where every half-hearted change of subject could be punctured by a brief, “But what about the Nisha call?” Midnight passed without notice as we looked to a date five days hence.“If she ends it with another meditation on epistemology, I swear,” one partygoer scoffed, implying that if Sarah Koenig did not reveal precisely whodunit, she’d meet a fate worse than Leakin Park.</p>

Sparse Matrices are large data structure containing mostly zeroes and a few ones. They occur frequently as the solution to differential equations in engineering applications, where they prove troublesome because they waste space throughout computation. They also occur on page 42 of the Winter 2011 Blueprint issue of The Harvard Advocate, though unrecognizable from this definition. From the page, vibrant neons erupt into symmetric, organic forms. Computer simulations are grafted onto the sterile negative, flattening time and space in turn and leaving the array of images meaningless, authorless, incorporeal, yet alive.Like optical illusions of fleeting grey squares, the eye chases meaning throughout the grid of images, the entire submission a macrosystem, a matrix of matrices, whose opacity conceals the spectral ones and zeroes that endow indices with meaning or its absence.</p>

            <p class="post-teaser">On the rock, grains glued in silica, I stick close to myself. A dried oak wanders outward from the mountain’s negative. Roots snake through cracks. Two stuck stones, starting &amp; staying, have fallen into each other: locked ready to shake off. It was the glacier, Wisconsin, that did it, carving thick braids of sentiment out of quartz. Now it’s another’s move. My arms are ticking. Full of adrenaline and blood, it’s too much for skin to hold, the forearms tendons fingers cable out to grimace the wall and I pendulum over the sheer apex of New York, crossing a crux, splitting I or some part making it out to that face. The bent joint of rock. Exposed and hung out to dry. Sun pools on my back. Bullets of sweat vanish from my head’s crown. There’s nothing to the south of me. All those untouched oaks, sycamore, euphorbia—&amp; underneath huckleberries drop from the bush into lily ponds full of machine-voiced frogs.</p>

One dappled banana chopped over a sprinkling of strawberries, coated with a simple-syrup drizzle to brighten the dollop of tang marketed as Greek. It needs ice, and milk, and the employee adds them as I throw a fistful of singles at the register. Nine minutes.Across the concourse, four friends wait for a boost of caffeine delivered in 100-calorie gulps. One latté, one cappuccino, one chai, one black coffee. Eight minutes, and the girl in the Pinkberry hat and Pinkberry apron and Pinkberry polo pours the pink slurry into a cup, just for me.</p>

The pink and blue Ferris wheel costs a suggested donation of four dollars. A line forms only when we approach the empty, swirling machine: three pale bodies, SPF 70 insured today, guaranteed to wake up tomorrow with flecks of skin peeling off red noses. To find our faces in the crowd, look for one boy with glasses, and another in a black Ché cap. Next to them you will find me, with rounder glasses and a backward, paisley hat.

Last night the domed friend hosted a party for his start-up. He’s the intern. In a room of ten 30-something paunchy Indian men, we ate multiple Chipotle build-your-own-burritos while playing Cards Against Humanity. Several cards required explaining to the company CEO. Until 11pm, we were not the only attendees under twenty-one. There were two others, the CEO’s toddler twins, who tumbled around the party, sucking on closed primary-colored beer cans that might one day make a great #tbt.</p>
